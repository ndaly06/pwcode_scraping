We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an\\noriented text detection method. The main idea is to decom-\\npose text into two locally detectable elements, namely seg-\\nments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering a\\npart of a word or text line; A link connects two adjacent\\nsegments, indicating that they belong to the same word or\\ntext line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple\\nscales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural\\nnetwork. Final detections are produced by combining seg-\\nments connected by links. Compared with previous meth-\\nods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy,\\nspeed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of\\n75.0% on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge\\n4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large\\nmargin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512×512 images. More-\\nover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long\\nlines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nReading text in natural images is a challenging task un-\\nder active research. It is driven by many real-world appli-\\ncations, such as Photo OCR [2], geo-location, and image\\nretrieval [9]. In a text reading system, text detection, i.e.\\nlocalizing text with bounding boxes of words or text lines,\\nis usually the first step of great significance. In a sense, text\\ndetection can be seen as object detection applied to text,\\nwhere words/characters/text lines are taken as the detection\\ntargets. Owing to this, a new trend has emerged recently\\nthat state-of-the-art text detection methods [9, 6, 22, 30] are\\nheavily based on the advanced general object detection or\\nsegmentation techniques, e.g. [4, 5, 15].\\n\\nDespite the great success of the previous work, we ar-\\ngue that the general detection methods are not well suited\\n\\n∗Corresponding author.\\n\\n(a) (b) (c)\\n\\n(d) (e) (f)\\n\\nFigure 1. SegLink Overview. The upper row shows an image\\nwith two words of different scales and orientations. (a) Segments\\n(yellow boxes) are detected on the image. (b) Links (green lines)\\nare detected between pairs of adjacent segments. (c) Segments\\nconnected by links are combined into whole words. (d-f) SegLink\\nis able to detect long lines of Latin and non-Latin text, such as\\nChinese.\\n\\nfor text detection, for two main reasons. First, word/text\\nline bounding boxes have much larger aspect ratios than\\nthose of general objects. An (fast/faster) R-CNN [5, 4, 19]-\\nor SSD [14]-style detector may suffer from the difficulty\\nof producing such boxes, owing to its proposal or anchor\\nbox design. In addition, some non-Latin text does not have\\nblank spaces between words, hence the even larger bound-\\ning box aspect ratios, which make the problem worse. Sec-\\nond, unlike general objects, text usually has a clear defini-\\ntion of orientation [25]. It is important for a text detector to\\nproduce oriented boxes. However, most general object de-\\ntection methods are not designed to produce oriented boxes.\\n\\nTo overcome the above challenges, we tackle the text de-\\ntection problem in a new perspective. We propose to de-\\ncompose long text into two smaller and locally-detectable\\nelements, namely segment and link.

Convolutional filters are specified in the format of “(#filters),k(kernel size)s(stride)”. A multi-line filter specification\\nmeans a hidden layer between. Segments (yellow boxes) and links (not displayed) are detected by convolutional predictors on multiple\\nfeature layers (indexed by l = 1 . . . 6) and combined into whole words by a combining algorithm.\\n\\n(for clarity we use “word” here and later on, but segments\\nalso work seamlessly on text lines that comprise multiple\\nwords); A link connects a pair of adjacent segments, indi-\\ncating that they belong to the same word. Under the above\\ndefinitions, a word is located by a number of segments\\nwith links between them. During detection, segments and\\nlinks are densely detected on an input image by a convo-\\nlutional neural network. Then, the segments are combined\\ninto whole words according to the links.\\n\\nThe key advantage of this approach is that long and ori-\\nented text is now detected locally since both basic elements\\nare locally-detectable: Detecting a segment does not require\\nthe whole word to be observed. And neither does a link\\nsince the connection of two segments can be inferred from\\na local context. Thereafter, we can detect text of any length\\nand orientation with great flexibility and efficiency.\\n\\nConcretely, we propose a convolutional neural network\\n(CNN) model to detect both segments and links simultane-\\nously, in a fully-convolutional manner. The network uses\\nVGG-16 [21] as its backbone. A few extra feature lay-\\ners are added onto it. Convolutional predictors are added\\nto 6 of the feature layers to detect segments and links at\\ndifferent scales. To deal with redundant detections, we in-\\ntroduce two types of links, namely within-layer links and\\ncross-layer links. A within-layer link connects a segment\\nto its neighbors on the same layer. A cross-layer link, on\\nthe other hand, connects a segment to its neighbors on the\\nlower layer. In this way, we connect segments of adjacent\\nlocations as well as scales. Finally, we find connected seg-\\nments with a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and com-\\nbine them into whole words.\\n\\nOur main contribution is the novel segment-linking de-\\n\\ntection method. Through experiments, we show that the\\nproposed method possesses several distinctive advantages\\nover the other state-of-the-art methods: 1) Robustness:\\nSegLink models the structure of oriented text in a simple\\nand elegant way, with robustness against complex back-\\ngrounds. Our method achieves highly competitive results\\non standard datasets. In particular, it outperforms the previ-\\nous best by a large margin in terms of f-measure (75.0% vs\\n64.8%) on the ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) bench-\\nmark [12]; 2) Efficiency: SegLink is highly efficient due\\nto its single-pass, fully-convolutional design. It processes\\nmore than 20 images of 512x512 size per second; 3) Gener-\\nality: Without modification, SegLink is able to detect long\\nlines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. We demonstrate\\nthis capability on a multi-lingual dataset.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n\\nText Detection Over the past few years, much research\\neffort has been devoted to the text detection problem [24,\\n23, 17, 17, 25, 7, 8, 30, 29, 2, 9, 6, 22, 26]. Based on the ba-\\nsic detection targets, the previous methods can be roughly\\ndivided into three categories: character-based, word-based\\nand line-based. Character-based methods [17, 23, 24, 10, 7,\\n8] detect individual characters and group them into words.\\nThese methods find characters by classifying candidate re-\\ngions extracted by region extraction algorithms or by classi-\\nfying sliding windows. Such methods often involve a post-\\nprocessing step of grouping characters into words. Word-\\nbased methods [9, 6] directly detect word bounding boxes.\\nThey often have a similar pipeline to the recent CNN-based\\ngeneral object detection networks. Though achieving ex-\\ncellent detection accuracies, these methods may suffer from\\n\\n\\n\\nperformance drop when applied to some non-Latin text such\\nas Chinese, as we mentioned earlier. Line-based meth-\\nods [29, 30, 26] find text regions using some image seg-\\nmentation algorithms. They also require a sophisticated\\npost-processing step of word partitioning and/or false pos-\\nitive removal. Compared with the previous approaches,\\nour method predicts segments and links jointly in a single\\nforward network pass. The pipeline is much simpler and\\ncleaner. Moreover, the network is end-to-end trainable.\\n\\nOur method is similar in spirit to a recent work [22],\\nwhich detects text lines by finding and grouping a sequence\\nof fine-scale text proposals through a CNN coupled with\\nrecurrent neural layers. In contrast, we detect oriented seg-\\nments only using convolutional layers, yielding better flexi-\\nbility and faster speed. Also, we detect links explicitly using\\nthe same strong CNN features for segments, improving the\\nrobustness.\\n\\nObject Detection Text detection can be seen as a partic-\\nular instance of general object detection, which is a funda-\\nmental problem in computer vision. Most state-of-the-art\\ndetection systems either classify some class-agnostic ob-\\nject proposals with CNN [5, 4, 19] or directly regress ob-\\nject bounding boxes from a set of preset boxes (e.g. anchor\\nboxes) [18, 14].\\n\\nThe architecture of our network inherits that of SSD [14],\\na recent object detection model. SSD proposed the idea of\\ndetecting objects on multiple feature layers with convolu-\\ntional predictors. Our model also detects segments and links\\nin a very similar way. Despite the model similarity, our de-\\ntection strategy is drastically different: SSD directly out-\\nputs object bounding boxes. We, on the other hand, adopt\\na bottom-up approach by detecting the two comprising ele-\\nments of a word or text line and combine them together.\\n\\n3. Segment Linking\\nOur method detects text with a feed-forward CNN\\n\\nmodel. Given an input image I of size wI × hI , the model\\noutputs a fixed number of segments and links, which are\\nthen filtered by their confidence scores and combined into\\nwhole word bounding boxes. A bounding box is a ro-\\ntated rectangle denoted by b = (xb, yb, wb, hb, θb), where\\nxb, yb are the coordinates of the center, wb, hb the width\\nand height, and θb the rotation angle.\\n\\n3.1. CNN Model\\n\\nFig. 2 shows the network architecture. Our network uses\\na pretrained VGG-16 network [21] as its backbone (conv1\\nthrough pool5). Following [14], the fully-connected layers\\nof VGG-16 are converted into convolutional layers (fc6 to\\nconv6; fc7 to conv7). They are followed by a few extra con-\\nvolutional layers (conv8 1 to conv11), which extract even\\n\\ndeeper features with larger receptive fields. Their configu-\\nrations are specified in Fig. 2.\\n\\nSegments and links are detected on 6 of the feature lay-\\ners, which are conv4 3, conv7, conv8 2, conv9 2, conv10 2,\\nand conv11. These feature layers provide high-quality deep\\nfeatures of different granularity (conv4 3 the finest and\\nconv11 the coarsest). A convolutional predictor with 3 × 3\\nkernels is added to each of the 6 layers to detect segments\\nand links. We index the feature layers and the predictors by\\nl = 1, . . . , 6.\\n\\nSegment Detection Segments are also oriented boxes, de-\\nnoted by s = (xs, ys, ws, hs, θs). We detect segments by\\nestimating the confidence scores and geometric offsets to a\\nset of default boxes [14] on the input image. Each default\\nbox is associated with a feature map location, and its score\\nand offsets are predicted from the features at that location.\\nFor simplicity, we only associate one default box with a fea-\\nture map location.\\n\\nConsider the l-th feature layer whose feature map size\\nis wl × hl. A location (x, y) on this map corresponds to a\\ndefault box centered at (xa, ya) on the image, where\\n\\nxa =\\nwI\\nwl\\n\\n(x+ 0.5); ya =\\nhI\\nhl\\n\\n(y + 0.5) (1)\\n\\nThe width and height of the default box are both set to a\\nconstant al.\\n\\nThe convolutional predictor produces 7 channels for\\nsegment detection. Among them, 2 channels are further\\nsoftmax-normalized to get the segment score in (0, 1). The\\nrest 5 are the geometric offsets. Considering a location\\n(x, y) on the map, we denote the vector at this location\\nalong the depth by (∆xs, ∆ys, ∆ws, ∆hs, ∆θs). Then,\\nthe segment at this location is calculated by:\\n\\nxs = al∆xs + xa (2)\\nys = al∆ys + ya (3)\\nws = al exp(∆ws) (4)\\nhs = al exp(∆hs) (5)\\nθs = ∆θs (6)\\n\\nHere, the constant al controls the scale of the output seg-\\nments. It should be chosen with regard to the receptive\\nfield size of the l-th layer. We use an empirical equation\\nfor choosing this size: al = γ wIwl , where γ = 1.5.\\n\\nWithin-Layer Link Detection A link connects a pair of\\nadjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same\\nword. Here, adjacent segments are those detected at adja-\\ncent feature map locations. Links are not only necessary for\\ncombining segments into whole words but also helpful for\\nseparating two nearby words – between two nearby words,\\nthe links should be predicted as negative.\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Within-\\nLayer Links\\n\\n(b) Cross-\\nLayer Links\\n\\n2x \\nsize\\n\\nconv8_2\\n\\nconv8_2\\n\\nconv9_2\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\n16\\n\\nFigure 3. Within-Layer and Cross-Layer Links. (a) A location\\non conv8 2 (yellow block) and its 8-connected neighbors (blue\\nblocks with and without fill). The detected within-layer links\\n(green lines) connect a segment (yellow box) and its two neigh-\\nboring segments (blue boxes) on the same layer. (b) The cross-\\nlayer links connect a segment on conv9 2 (yellow box) and two\\nsegments on conv8 2 (blue boxes).\\n\\nWe explicitly detect links between segments using the\\nsame features for detecting segments. Since we detect only\\none segment at a feature map location, segments can be\\nindexed by their map locations (x, y) and layer indexes l,\\ndenoted by s(x,y,l). As illustrated in Fig. 3.a, we define\\nthe within-layer neighbors of a segment as its 8-connected\\nneighbors on the same feature layer:\\n\\nNws(x,y,l) = {s\\n(x′,y′,l)}x−1≤x′≤x+1,y−1≤y′≤y+1 \\\\ s(x,y,l)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nAs segments are detected locally, a pair of neighboring seg-\\nments are also adjacent on input image. Links are also de-\\ntected by the convolutional predictors. A predictor outputs\\n16 channels for the links to the 8-connected neighboring\\nsegments. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to get\\nthe score of a link.\\n\\nCross-Layer Link Detection In our network, segments\\nare detected at different scales on different feature layers.\\nEach layer handles a range of scales. We make these ranges\\noverlap in order not to miss scales at their edges. But as\\na result, segments of the same word could be detected on\\nmultiple layers at the same time, producing redundancies.\\n\\nTo address this problem, we further propose another\\ntype of links, called cross-layer links. A cross-layer link\\nconnects segments on two feature layers with adjacent in-\\ndexes. For example, cross-layer links are detected between\\nconv4 3 and conv7, because their indexes are l = 1 and\\nl = 2 respectively.\\n\\nAn important property of such a pair is that the first layer\\nalways has twice the size as the second one, because of the\\n\\ndown-sampling layer (max-pooling or stride-2 convolution)\\nbetween them. Note that this property only holds when all\\nfeature layers have even-numbered sizes. In practice, we\\nensured this property by having the width and height of the\\ninput image both dividable by 128. For example, an 1000×\\n800 image is resized to 1024 × 768, which is the nearest\\nvalid size.\\n\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3.b, we define the cross-layer\\nneighbors of a segment as\\n\\n(8)N cs(x,y,l) = {s\\n(x′,y′,l−1)}2x≤x′≤2x+1,2y≤y′≤2y+1,\\n\\nwhich are the segments on the preceeding layer. Every seg-\\nment has 4 cross-layer neighbors. The correspondence is\\nensured by the double-size relationship between the two\\nlayers.\\n\\nAgain, cross-layer links are detected by the convolu-\\ntional predictor. The predictor outputs 8 channels for cross-\\nlayer links. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to\\nproduce the score of a cross-layer link. Cross-layer links\\nare detected on feature layer l = 2 . . . 6, but not on l = 1\\n(conv4 3) since it has no preceeding feature layer.\\n\\nWith cross-layer links, segments of different scales can\\nbe connected and later combined. Compared with the tradi-\\ntional non-maximum suppression, cross-layer linking pro-\\nvides a trainable way of joining redundancies. Besides, it\\nfits seamlessly into our linking strategy and is easy to im-\\nplement under our framework.\\n\\nsegment \\nscores\\n\\nsegment \\noffsets\\n\\nwithin-layer \\nlink scores\\n\\ncross-layer \\nlink scores\\n\\n2 5 16 8\\n𝑤\"\\n\\nℎ\"\\n\\nFigure 4.

A predictor is implemented by a convolutional\\nlayer followed by some softmax layers that normalize the\\nsegment and link scores respectively. Thereafter, all lay-\\ners in our network are convolutional layers. Our network is\\nfully-convolutional.\\n\\n3.2. Combining Segments with Links\\n\\nAfter feed-forwarding, the network produces a number\\nof segments and links (the number depends on the image\\nsize). Before combination, the output segments and links\\nare filtered by their confidence scores. We set different fil-\\ntering thresholds for segment and link, respectively α and β.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmpirically, the performance of our model is not very sensi-\\ntive to these thresholds. A 0.1 deviation on either thresholds\\nfrom their optimal values results in less than 1% f-measure\\ndrop.\\n\\nTaking the filtered segments as nodes and the filtered\\nlinks as edges, we construct a graph over them. Then, a\\ndepth-first search (DFS) is performed over the graph to find\\nits connected components. Each component contains a set\\nof segments that are connected by links. Denoting a con-\\nnected component by B, segments within this component\\nare combined following the procedures in Alg. 1.\\n\\nAlgorithm 1 Combining Segments\\n\\n1: Input: B = {s(i)}|B|i=1 is a set of segments connected\\nby links, where s(i) = (x(i)s , y\\n\\n(i)\\ns , w\\n\\n(i)\\ns , h\\n\\n(i)\\ns , θ\\n\\n(i)\\ns ).\\n\\n2: Find the average angle θb := 1|B|\\n∑\\nB θ\\n\\n(i)\\ns .\\n\\n3: For a straight line (tan θb)x + b, find the b that min-\\nimizes the sum of distances to all segment centers\\n(x\\n\\n(i)\\ns , y\\n\\n(i)\\ns ).\\n\\n4: Find the perpendicular projections of all segment cen-\\nters onto the straight line.\\n\\n5: From the projected points, find the two with the longest\\ndistance.

Training\\n4.1. Groundtruths of Segments and Links\\n\\nThe network is trained by the direct supervision of\\ngroundtruth segments and links. The groundtruths include\\nthe labels of all default boxes (i.e. the label of their corre-\\nsponding segments), their offsets to the default boxes, and\\nthe labels of all within- and cross-layer links. We calculate\\nthem from the groundtruth word bounding boxes.\\n\\nFirst, we assume that there is only one groundtruth word\\non the input image. A default box is labeled as positive iff\\n1) the center of the box is inside the word bounding box;\\n2) the ratio between the box size al and the word height h\\nsatisfies:\\n\\nmax(\\nal\\nh\\n,\\nh\\n\\nal\\n) ≤ 1.5 (9)\\n\\nOtherwise, the default box is labeled as negative.\\nNext, we consider the case of multiple words. A default\\n\\nbox is labeled as negative if it does not meet the above-\\nmentioned criteria for any word. Otherwise, it is labeled as\\n\\npositive and matched to the word that has the closest size,\\ni.e. the one with the minimal value at the left-hand side of\\nEq. 9.\\n\\nword \\nbounding box\\n\\ndefault box\\n\\nbox center\\n\\n𝜃\\n\\n(1) Default box, word bounding box, and \\nthe center of the default box (blue dot)\\n\\n(2) Rotate word clockwise by 𝜃 along \\nthe center of the default box\\n\\n(3) Crop word bounding box to remove \\nthe parts to the left and right of the \\ndefault box\\n\\n(4) Rotate the cropped box \\nanticlockwise by 𝜃 along the center of \\nthe default box\\n\\n𝑎\\n\\nℎ\\n\\n𝑤% \\t\\ngroundtruth \\n\\nsegment\\n\\nℎ%\\t\\n𝑥%, 𝑦%\\n\\nFigure 5.

Optimization\\n\\nObjective Our network model is trained by simultane-\\nously minimizing the losses on segment classification, off-\\nsets regression, and link classification. Overall, the loss\\nfunction is a weighted sum of the three losses:\\n\\nL(ys, cs,yl, cl, ŝ, s) =\\n1\\n\\nNs\\nLconf(ys, cs)+λ1\\n\\n1\\n\\nNs\\nLloc(ŝ, s)\\n\\n+ λ2\\n1\\n\\nNl\\nLconf(yl, cl)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nHere, ys is the labels of all segments. y\\n(i)\\ns = 1 if the i-th\\n\\ndefault box is labeled as positive, and 0 otherwise. Like-\\nwise, yl is the labels of the links. Lconf is the softmax loss\\nover the predicted segment and link scores, respectively cs\\nand cl. Lloc is the Smooth L1 regression loss [4] over the\\npredicted segment geometries ŝ and the groundtruth s. The\\nlosses on segment classification and regression are normal-\\nized by Ns, which is the number of positive default boxes.\\nThe loss on link classification is normalized by the number\\nof positive links Nl. The weight constants λ1 and λ2 are\\nboth set to 1 in practice.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Hard Negative Mining For both segments and\\nlinks, negatives take up most of the training samples. There-\\nfore, hard negative mining is necessary for balancing the\\npositive and negative samples. We follow the online hard\\nnegative mining strategy proposed in [20] to keep the ra-\\ntio between the negatives and positives 3:1 at most. Hard\\nnegative mining is performed separately for segments and\\nlinks.\\n\\nData Augmentation We adopt an online augmentation\\npipeline that is similar to that of SSD [14] and YOLO [18].\\nTraining images are randomly cropped to a patch that has a\\nminimum Jaccard overlap of o with any groundtruth word\\nCrops are resized to the same size before loaded into a\\nbatch. For oriented text, the augmentation is performed on\\nthe axis-aligned bounding boxes of the words. The overlap\\no is randomly chosen from 0 (no constraint), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\\n0.7, and 0.9 for every sample. The crop size is randomly\\nchosen from [0.1, 1] of the original image size. Training\\nimages are not horizontally flipped.\\n\\n5. Experiments\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate the proposed method on three\\npublic datasets, namely ICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (Chal-\\nlenge 4), MSRA-TD500, and ICDAR 2013, using the stan-\\ndard evaluation protocol of each.\\n\\n5.1. Datasets\\n\\nSynthText in the Wild (SynthText) [6] contains 800,000\\nsynthetic training images. They are created by blending nat-\\nural images with text rendered with random fonts, size, ori-\\nentation, and color. Text is rendered and aligned to care-\\nfully chosen image regions in order have a realistic look.\\nThe dataset provides very detailed annotations for charac-\\nters, words, and text lines. We only use the dataset for pre-\\ntraining our network.\\n\\nICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (IC15) [12] is the Chal-\\nlenge 4 of the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition.\\nThis challenge features incidental scene text images taken\\nby Google Glasses without taking care of positioning, im-\\nage quality, and viewpoint. Consequently, the dataset ex-\\nhibits large variations in text orientation, scale, and res-\\nolution, making it much more difficult than previous IC-\\nDAR challenges. The dataset contains 1000 training images\\nand 500 testing images. Annotations are provided as word\\nquadrilaterals.\\n\\nMSRA-TD500 (TD500) [25] is the first standard dataset\\nthat focuses on oriented text. The dataset is also multi-\\nlingual, including both Chinese and English text. The\\n\\ndataset consists of 300 training images and 200 testing im-\\nages. Different from IC15, TD500 is annotated at the level\\nof text lines.\\n\\nICDAR 2013 (IC13) [13] contains mostly horizontal text,\\nwith some text slightly oriented. The dataset has been\\nwidely adopted for evaluating text detection methods pre-\\nviously. It consists of 229 training images and 233 testing\\nimages.\\n\\n5.2. Implementation Details\\n\\nOur network is pre-trained on SynthText and finetuned\\non real datasets (specified later). It is optimized by the stan-\\ndard SGD algorithm with a momentum of 0.9. For both pre-\\ntraining and finetuning, images are resized to 384×384 after\\nrandom cropping. Since our model is fully-convolutional,\\nwe can train it on a certain size and apply it to other sizes\\nduring testing. Batch size is set to 32. In pretraining, the\\nlearning is set to 10−3 for the first 60k iterations, then de-\\ncayed to 10−4 for the rest 30k iterations. During finetuning,\\nthe learning rate is fixed to 10−4 for 5-10k iterations. The\\nnumber of finetuning iterations depends on the size of the\\ndataset.\\n\\nDue to the precision-recall tradeoff and the difference\\nbetween evaluation protocols across datasets, we choose\\nthe best thresholds α and β to optimize f-measure. Except\\nfor IC15, the thresholds are chosen separately on different\\ndatasets via a grid search with 0.1 step on a hold-out vali-\\ndation set. IC15 does not offer an offline evaluation script,\\nso the only way for us is to submit multiple results to the\\nevaluation server.\\n\\nOur method is implemented using TensorFlow [1] r0.11.\\nAll the experiments are carried out on a workstation with\\nan Intel Xeon 8-core CPU (2.8 GHz), 4 Titan X Graphics\\nCards, and 64GB RAM. Running on 4 GPUs in parallel,\\ntraining a batch takes about 0.5s. The whole training pro-\\ncess takes less than a day.\\n\\n5.3. Detecting Oriented English Text\\n\\nFirst, we evaluate SegLink on IC15. The pretrained\\nmodel is finetuned for 10k iterations on the training dataset\\nof IC15. Testing images are resized to 1280 × 768. We set\\nthe thresholds on segments and links to 0.9 and 0.7, respec-\\ntively. Performance is evaluated by the official central sub-\\nmission server (http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4).\\nIn order to meet the requirements on submission format, the\\noutput oriented rectangles are converted into quadrilaterals.\\n\\nTable 1 lists and compares the results of the proposed\\nmethod and other state-of-the-art methods. Some results are\\nobtained from the online leaderboard. SegLink outperforms\\nthe others by a large margin. In terms of f-measure, it out-\\nperforms the second best by 10.2%. Considering that some\\nmethods have close or even higher precision than SegLink,\\n\\nhttp://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4\\n\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=0.86    F-Score=0.92 Recall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0 Recall=0.88    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.88\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.93\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0\\n\\nFigure 6.

Detecting Multi-Lingual Text in Long Lines\\n\\nWe further demonstrate the ability of SegLink to detect\\nlong text in non-Latin scripts. TD500 is taken as the dataset\\nfor this experiment, as it consists of oriented and multi-\\nlingual text. The training set of TD500 only has 300 im-\\nages, which are not enough for finetuning our model. We\\nmix the training set of TD500 with the training set of IC15,\\nin the way that every batch has half of its images coming\\nfrom each dataset.

Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented SegLink, a novel text detection strat-\\negy implemented by a simple and highly-efficient CNN\\nmodel.

In the future, we\\nwill further explore its potentials on detecting deformed text\\nsuch as curved text. Also, we are interested in extending\\nSegLink into a end-to-end recognition system.\\n\\nAcknowledgment\\n\\nThis work was supported in part by National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China (61222308 and 61573160),\\na Google Focused Research Award, AWS Cloud Credits\\nfor Research, a Microsoft Research Award and a Facebook\\nequipment donation.

We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an\\noriented text detection method. The main idea is to decom-\\npose text into two locally detectable elements, namely seg-\\nments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering a\\npart of a word or text line; A link connects two adjacent\\nsegments, indicating that they belong to the same word or\\ntext line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple\\nscales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural\\nnetwork. Final detections are produced by combining seg-\\nments connected by links. Compared with previous meth-\\nods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy,\\nspeed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of\\n75.0% on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge\\n4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large\\nmargin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512\\xc3\\x97512 images. More-\\nover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long\\nlines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nReading text in natural images is a challenging task un-\\nder active research. It is driven by many real-world appli-\\ncations, such as Photo OCR [2], geo-location, and image\\nretrieval [9]. In a text reading system, text detection, i.e.\\nlocalizing text with bounding boxes of words or text lines,\\nis usually the first step of great significance. In a sense, text\\ndetection can be seen as object detection applied to text,\\nwhere words/characters/text lines are taken as the detection\\ntargets. Owing to this, a new trend has emerged recently\\nthat state-of-the-art text detection methods [9, 6, 22, 30] are\\nheavily based on the advanced general object detection or\\nsegmentation techniques, e.g. [4, 5, 15].\\n\\nDespite the great success of the previous work, we ar-\\ngue that the general detection methods are not well suited\\n\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97Corresponding author.\\n\\n(a) (b) (c)\\n\\n(d) (e) (f)\\n\\nFigure 1. SegLink Overview. The upper row shows an image\\nwith two words of different scales and orientations. (a) Segments\\n(yellow boxes) are detected on the image. (b) Links (green lines)\\nare detected between pairs of adjacent segments. (c) Segments\\nconnected by links are combined into whole words. (d-f) SegLink\\nis able to detect long lines of Latin and non-Latin text, such as\\nChinese.\\n\\nfor text detection, for two main reasons. First, word/text\\nline bounding boxes have much larger aspect ratios than\\nthose of general objects. An (fast/faster) R-CNN [5, 4, 19]-\\nor SSD [14]-style detector may suffer from the difficulty\\nof producing such boxes, owing to its proposal or anchor\\nbox design. In addition, some non-Latin text does not have\\nblank spaces between words, hence the even larger bound-\\ning box aspect ratios, which make the problem worse. Sec-\\nond, unlike general objects, text usually has a clear defini-\\ntion of orientation [25]. It is important for a text detector to\\nproduce oriented boxes. However, most general object de-\\ntection methods are not designed to produce oriented boxes.\\n\\nTo overcome the above challenges, we tackle the text de-\\ntection problem in a new perspective. We propose to de-\\ncompose long text into two smaller and locally-detectable\\nelements, namely segment and link. As illustrated in Fig. 1,\\na segment is an oriented box that covers a part of a word\\n\\nar\\nX\\n\\niv\\n:1\\n\\n70\\n3.\\n\\n06\\n52\\n\\n0v\\n3 \\n\\n [\\ncs\\n\\n.C\\nV\\n\\n] \\n 1\\n\\n3 \\nA\\n\\npr\\n 2\\n\\n01\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n64\\n\\n512\\n\\nVGG16 \\nthrough \\npool5\\n\\nconv\\n4_3\\n\\nInput Image (512x512)\\n\\n32\\n\\n1024\\n\\nconv7\\n(fc7)\\n\\n16\\n\\n1024\\n\\nconv\\n8_2\\n\\n8\\n\\n512\\n\\nconv\\n9_2 conv\\n\\n10_24 conv11\\n\\nCombining \\nSegments\\n\\nDetections\\n\\n256\\n\\n2\\n\\n256\\n\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 1 \\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 6\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 2 \\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 3 \\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 4 \\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x99 = 5\\n\\n3x3 conv \\npredictors\\n\\n1024,k3s1\\n1024,k1s1\\n\\n256,k1s1\\n512,k3s2\\n\\n128,k1s1\\n256,k3s2\\n\\n128,k1s1\\n256,k3s2\\n\\n256,k3s2\\n\\nFigure 2. Network Architecture. The network consists of convolutional feature layers (shown as gray blocks) and convolutional predictors\\n(thin gray arrows). Convolutional filters are specified in the format of \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(#filters),k(kernel size)s(stride)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. A multi-line filter specification\\nmeans a hidden layer between. Segments (yellow boxes) and links (not displayed) are detected by convolutional predictors on multiple\\nfeature layers (indexed by l = 1 . . . 6) and combined into whole words by a combining algorithm.\\n\\n(for clarity we use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cword\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here and later on, but segments\\nalso work seamlessly on text lines that comprise multiple\\nwords); A link connects a pair of adjacent segments, indi-\\ncating that they belong to the same word. Under the above\\ndefinitions, a word is located by a number of segments\\nwith links between them. During detection, segments and\\nlinks are densely detected on an input image by a convo-\\nlutional neural network. Then, the segments are combined\\ninto whole words according to the links.\\n\\nThe key advantage of this approach is that long and ori-\\nented text is now detected locally since both basic elements\\nare locally-detectable: Detecting a segment does not require\\nthe whole word to be observed. And neither does a link\\nsince the connection of two segments can be inferred from\\na local context. Thereafter, we can detect text of any length\\nand orientation with great flexibility and efficiency.\\n\\nConcretely, we propose a convolutional neural network\\n(CNN) model to detect both segments and links simultane-\\nously, in a fully-convolutional manner. The network uses\\nVGG-16 [21] as its backbone. A few extra feature lay-\\ners are added onto it. Convolutional predictors are added\\nto 6 of the feature layers to detect segments and links at\\ndifferent scales. To deal with redundant detections, we in-\\ntroduce two types of links, namely within-layer links and\\ncross-layer links. A within-layer link connects a segment\\nto its neighbors on the same layer. A cross-layer link, on\\nthe other hand, connects a segment to its neighbors on the\\nlower layer. In this way, we connect segments of adjacent\\nlocations as well as scales. Finally, we find connected seg-\\nments with a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and com-\\nbine them into whole words.\\n\\nOur main contribution is the novel segment-linking de-\\n\\ntection method. Through experiments, we show that the\\nproposed method possesses several distinctive advantages\\nover the other state-of-the-art methods: 1) Robustness:\\nSegLink models the structure of oriented text in a simple\\nand elegant way, with robustness against complex back-\\ngrounds. Our method achieves highly competitive results\\non standard datasets. In particular, it outperforms the previ-\\nous best by a large margin in terms of f-measure (75.0% vs\\n64.8%) on the ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) bench-\\nmark [12]; 2) Efficiency: SegLink is highly efficient due\\nto its single-pass, fully-convolutional design. It processes\\nmore than 20 images of 512x512 size per second; 3) Gener-\\nality: Without modification, SegLink is able to detect long\\nlines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. We demonstrate\\nthis capability on a multi-lingual dataset.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n\\nText Detection Over the past few years, much research\\neffort has been devoted to the text detection problem [24,\\n23, 17, 17, 25, 7, 8, 30, 29, 2, 9, 6, 22, 26]. Based on the ba-\\nsic detection targets, the previous methods can be roughly\\ndivided into three categories: character-based, word-based\\nand line-based. Character-based methods [17, 23, 24, 10, 7,\\n8] detect individual characters and group them into words.\\nThese methods find characters by classifying candidate re-\\ngions extracted by region extraction algorithms or by classi-\\nfying sliding windows. Such methods often involve a post-\\nprocessing step of grouping characters into words. Word-\\nbased methods [9, 6] directly detect word bounding boxes.\\nThey often have a similar pipeline to the recent CNN-based\\ngeneral object detection networks. Though achieving ex-\\ncellent detection accuracies, these methods may suffer from\\n\\n\\n\\nperformance drop when applied to some non-Latin text such\\nas Chinese, as we mentioned earlier. Line-based meth-\\nods [29, 30, 26] find text regions using some image seg-\\nmentation algorithms. They also require a sophisticated\\npost-processing step of word partitioning and/or false pos-\\nitive removal. Compared with the previous approaches,\\nour method predicts segments and links jointly in a single\\nforward network pass. The pipeline is much simpler and\\ncleaner. Moreover, the network is end-to-end trainable.\\n\\nOur method is similar in spirit to a recent work [22],\\nwhich detects text lines by finding and grouping a sequence\\nof fine-scale text proposals through a CNN coupled with\\nrecurrent neural layers. In contrast, we detect oriented seg-\\nments only using convolutional layers, yielding better flexi-\\nbility and faster speed. Also, we detect links explicitly using\\nthe same strong CNN features for segments, improving the\\nrobustness.\\n\\nObject Detection Text detection can be seen as a partic-\\nular instance of general object detection, which is a funda-\\nmental problem in computer vision. Most state-of-the-art\\ndetection systems either classify some class-agnostic ob-\\nject proposals with CNN [5, 4, 19] or directly regress ob-\\nject bounding boxes from a set of preset boxes (e.g. anchor\\nboxes) [18, 14].\\n\\nThe architecture of our network inherits that of SSD [14],\\na recent object detection model. SSD proposed the idea of\\ndetecting objects on multiple feature layers with convolu-\\ntional predictors. Our model also detects segments and links\\nin a very similar way. Despite the model similarity, our de-\\ntection strategy is drastically different: SSD directly out-\\nputs object bounding boxes. We, on the other hand, adopt\\na bottom-up approach by detecting the two comprising ele-\\nments of a word or text line and combine them together.\\n\\n3. Segment Linking\\nOur method detects text with a feed-forward CNN\\n\\nmodel. Given an input image I of size wI \\xc3\\x97 hI , the model\\noutputs a fixed number of segments and links, which are\\nthen filtered by their confidence scores and combined into\\nwhole word bounding boxes. A bounding box is a ro-\\ntated rectangle denoted by b = (xb, yb, wb, hb, \\xce\\xb8b), where\\nxb, yb are the coordinates of the center, wb, hb the width\\nand height, and \\xce\\xb8b the rotation angle.\\n\\n3.1. CNN Model\\n\\nFig. 2 shows the network architecture. Our network uses\\na pretrained VGG-16 network [21] as its backbone (conv1\\nthrough pool5). Following [14], the fully-connected layers\\nof VGG-16 are converted into convolutional layers (fc6 to\\nconv6; fc7 to conv7). They are followed by a few extra con-\\nvolutional layers (conv8 1 to conv11), which extract even\\n\\ndeeper features with larger receptive fields. Their configu-\\nrations are specified in Fig. 2.\\n\\nSegments and links are detected on 6 of the feature lay-\\ners, which are conv4 3, conv7, conv8 2, conv9 2, conv10 2,\\nand conv11. These feature layers provide high-quality deep\\nfeatures of different granularity (conv4 3 the finest and\\nconv11 the coarsest). A convolutional predictor with 3 \\xc3\\x97 3\\nkernels is added to each of the 6 layers to detect segments\\nand links. We index the feature layers and the predictors by\\nl = 1, . . . , 6.\\n\\nSegment Detection Segments are also oriented boxes, de-\\nnoted by s = (xs, ys, ws, hs, \\xce\\xb8s). We detect segments by\\nestimating the confidence scores and geometric offsets to a\\nset of default boxes [14] on the input image. Each default\\nbox is associated with a feature map location, and its score\\nand offsets are predicted from the features at that location.\\nFor simplicity, we only associate one default box with a fea-\\nture map location.\\n\\nConsider the l-th feature layer whose feature map size\\nis wl \\xc3\\x97 hl. A location (x, y) on this map corresponds to a\\ndefault box centered at (xa, ya) on the image, where\\n\\nxa =\\nwI\\nwl\\n\\n(x+ 0.5); ya =\\nhI\\nhl\\n\\n(y + 0.5) (1)\\n\\nThe width and height of the default box are both set to a\\nconstant al.\\n\\nThe convolutional predictor produces 7 channels for\\nsegment detection. Among them, 2 channels are further\\nsoftmax-normalized to get the segment score in (0, 1). The\\nrest 5 are the geometric offsets. Considering a location\\n(x, y) on the map, we denote the vector at this location\\nalong the depth by (\\xe2\\x88\\x86xs, \\xe2\\x88\\x86ys, \\xe2\\x88\\x86ws, \\xe2\\x88\\x86hs, \\xe2\\x88\\x86\\xce\\xb8s). Then,\\nthe segment at this location is calculated by:\\n\\nxs = al\\xe2\\x88\\x86xs + xa (2)\\nys = al\\xe2\\x88\\x86ys + ya (3)\\nws = al exp(\\xe2\\x88\\x86ws) (4)\\nhs = al exp(\\xe2\\x88\\x86hs) (5)\\n\\xce\\xb8s = \\xe2\\x88\\x86\\xce\\xb8s (6)\\n\\nHere, the constant al controls the scale of the output seg-\\nments. It should be chosen with regard to the receptive\\nfield size of the l-th layer. We use an empirical equation\\nfor choosing this size: al = \\xce\\xb3 wIwl , where \\xce\\xb3 = 1.5.\\n\\nWithin-Layer Link Detection A link connects a pair of\\nadjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same\\nword. Here, adjacent segments are those detected at adja-\\ncent feature map locations. Links are not only necessary for\\ncombining segments into whole words but also helpful for\\nseparating two nearby words \\xe2\\x80\\x93 between two nearby words,\\nthe links should be predicted as negative.\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Within-\\nLayer Links\\n\\n(b) Cross-\\nLayer Links\\n\\n2x \\nsize\\n\\nconv8_2\\n\\nconv8_2\\n\\nconv9_2\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\n16\\n\\nFigure 3. Within-Layer and Cross-Layer Links. (a) A location\\non conv8 2 (yellow block) and its 8-connected neighbors (blue\\nblocks with and without fill). The detected within-layer links\\n(green lines) connect a segment (yellow box) and its two neigh-\\nboring segments (blue boxes) on the same layer. (b) The cross-\\nlayer links connect a segment on conv9 2 (yellow box) and two\\nsegments on conv8 2 (blue boxes).\\n\\nWe explicitly detect links between segments using the\\nsame features for detecting segments. Since we detect only\\none segment at a feature map location, segments can be\\nindexed by their map locations (x, y) and layer indexes l,\\ndenoted by s(x,y,l). As illustrated in Fig. 3.a, we define\\nthe within-layer neighbors of a segment as its 8-connected\\nneighbors on the same feature layer:\\n\\nNws(x,y,l) = {s\\n(x\\xe2\\x80\\xb2,y\\xe2\\x80\\xb2,l)}x\\xe2\\x88\\x921\\xe2\\x89\\xa4x\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x89\\xa4x+1,y\\xe2\\x88\\x921\\xe2\\x89\\xa4y\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x89\\xa4y+1 \\\\ s(x,y,l)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nAs segments are detected locally, a pair of neighboring seg-\\nments are also adjacent on input image. Links are also de-\\ntected by the convolutional predictors. A predictor outputs\\n16 channels for the links to the 8-connected neighboring\\nsegments. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to get\\nthe score of a link.\\n\\nCross-Layer Link Detection In our network, segments\\nare detected at different scales on different feature layers.\\nEach layer handles a range of scales. We make these ranges\\noverlap in order not to miss scales at their edges. But as\\na result, segments of the same word could be detected on\\nmultiple layers at the same time, producing redundancies.\\n\\nTo address this problem, we further propose another\\ntype of links, called cross-layer links. A cross-layer link\\nconnects segments on two feature layers with adjacent in-\\ndexes. For example, cross-layer links are detected between\\nconv4 3 and conv7, because their indexes are l = 1 and\\nl = 2 respectively.\\n\\nAn important property of such a pair is that the first layer\\nalways has twice the size as the second one, because of the\\n\\ndown-sampling layer (max-pooling or stride-2 convolution)\\nbetween them. Note that this property only holds when all\\nfeature layers have even-numbered sizes. In practice, we\\nensured this property by having the width and height of the\\ninput image both dividable by 128. For example, an 1000\\xc3\\x97\\n800 image is resized to 1024 \\xc3\\x97 768, which is the nearest\\nvalid size.\\n\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3.b, we define the cross-layer\\nneighbors of a segment as\\n\\n(8)N cs(x,y,l) = {s\\n(x\\xe2\\x80\\xb2,y\\xe2\\x80\\xb2,l\\xe2\\x88\\x921)}2x\\xe2\\x89\\xa4x\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x89\\xa42x+1,2y\\xe2\\x89\\xa4y\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x89\\xa42y+1,\\n\\nwhich are the segments on the preceeding layer. Every seg-\\nment has 4 cross-layer neighbors. The correspondence is\\nensured by the double-size relationship between the two\\nlayers.\\n\\nAgain, cross-layer links are detected by the convolu-\\ntional predictor. The predictor outputs 8 channels for cross-\\nlayer links. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to\\nproduce the score of a cross-layer link. Cross-layer links\\nare detected on feature layer l = 2 . . . 6, but not on l = 1\\n(conv4 3) since it has no preceeding feature layer.\\n\\nWith cross-layer links, segments of different scales can\\nbe connected and later combined. Compared with the tradi-\\ntional non-maximum suppression, cross-layer linking pro-\\nvides a trainable way of joining redundancies. Besides, it\\nfits seamlessly into our linking strategy and is easy to im-\\nplement under our framework.\\n\\nsegment \\nscores\\n\\nsegment \\noffsets\\n\\nwithin-layer \\nlink scores\\n\\ncross-layer \\nlink scores\\n\\n2 5 16 8\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\xa4\"\\n\\n\\xe2\\x84\\x8e\"\\n\\nFigure 4.

A predictor is implemented by a convolutional\\nlayer followed by some softmax layers that normalize the\\nsegment and link scores respectively. Thereafter, all lay-\\ners in our network are convolutional layers. Our network is\\nfully-convolutional.\\n\\n3.2. Combining Segments with Links\\n\\nAfter feed-forwarding, the network produces a number\\nof segments and links (the number depends on the image\\nsize). Before combination, the output segments and links\\nare filtered by their confidence scores. We set different fil-\\ntering thresholds for segment and link, respectively \\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\xb2.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmpirically, the performance of our model is not very sensi-\\ntive to these thresholds. A 0.1 deviation on either thresholds\\nfrom their optimal values results in less than 1% f-measure\\ndrop.\\n\\nTaking the filtered segments as nodes and the filtered\\nlinks as edges, we construct a graph over them. Then, a\\ndepth-first search (DFS) is performed over the graph to find\\nits connected components. Each component contains a set\\nof segments that are connected by links. Denoting a con-\\nnected component by B, segments within this component\\nare combined following the procedures in Alg. 1.\\n\\nAlgorithm 1 Combining Segments\\n\\n1: Input: B = {s(i)}|B|i=1 is a set of segments connected\\nby links, where s(i) = (x(i)s , y\\n\\n(i)\\ns , w\\n\\n(i)\\ns , h\\n\\n(i)\\ns , \\xce\\xb8\\n\\n(i)\\ns ).\\n\\n2: Find the average angle \\xce\\xb8b := 1|B|\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x91\\nB \\xce\\xb8\\n\\n(i)\\ns .\\n\\n3: For a straight line (tan \\xce\\xb8b)x + b, find the b that min-\\nimizes the sum of distances to all segment centers\\n(x\\n\\n(i)\\ns , y\\n\\n(i)\\ns ).\\n\\n4: Find the perpendicular projections of all segment cen-\\nters onto the straight line.\\n\\n5: From the projected points, find the two with the longest\\ndistance.

Training\\n4.1. Groundtruths of Segments and Links\\n\\nThe network is trained by the direct supervision of\\ngroundtruth segments and links. The groundtruths include\\nthe labels of all default boxes (i.e. the label of their corre-\\nsponding segments), their offsets to the default boxes, and\\nthe labels of all within- and cross-layer links. We calculate\\nthem from the groundtruth word bounding boxes.\\n\\nFirst, we assume that there is only one groundtruth word\\non the input image. A default box is labeled as positive iff\\n1) the center of the box is inside the word bounding box;\\n2) the ratio between the box size al and the word height h\\nsatisfies:\\n\\nmax(\\nal\\nh\\n,\\nh\\n\\nal\\n) \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 1.5 (9)\\n\\nOtherwise, the default box is labeled as negative.\\nNext, we consider the case of multiple words. A default\\n\\nbox is labeled as negative if it does not meet the above-\\nmentioned criteria for any word. Otherwise, it is labeled as\\n\\npositive and matched to the word that has the closest size,\\ni.e. the one with the minimal value at the left-hand side of\\nEq. 9.\\n\\nword \\nbounding box\\n\\ndefault box\\n\\nbox center\\n\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x83\\n\\n(1) Default box, word bounding box, and \\nthe center of the default box (blue dot)\\n\\n(2) Rotate word clockwise by \\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x83 along \\nthe center of the default box\\n\\n(3) Crop word bounding box to remove \\nthe parts to the left and right of the \\ndefault box\\n\\n(4) Rotate the cropped box \\nanticlockwise by \\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x83 along the center of \\nthe default box\\n\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x8e\\n\\n\\xe2\\x84\\x8e\\n\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\xa4% \\t\\ngroundtruth \\n\\nsegment\\n\\n\\xe2\\x84\\x8e%\\t\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\xa5%, \\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\xa6%\\n\\nFigure 5. The steps of calculating a groundtruth segment given a\\ndefault box and a word bounding box.\\n\\nOffsets are calculated on positive default boxes. First,\\nwe calculate the groundtruth segments following the steps\\nillustrated in Fig. 5. Then, we solve Eq. 2 to Eq. 6 to get the\\ngroundtruth offsets.\\n\\nA link (either within-layer or cross-layer) is labeled as\\npositive iff 1) both of the default boxes connected to it are\\nlabeled as positive; 2) the two default boxes are matched to\\nthe same word.\\n\\n4.2. Optimization\\n\\nObjective Our network model is trained by simultane-\\nously minimizing the losses on segment classification, off-\\nsets regression, and link classification. Overall, the loss\\nfunction is a weighted sum of the three losses:\\n\\nL(ys, cs,yl, cl, s\\xcc\\x82, s) =\\n1\\n\\nNs\\nLconf(ys, cs)+\\xce\\xbb1\\n\\n1\\n\\nNs\\nLloc(s\\xcc\\x82, s)\\n\\n+ \\xce\\xbb2\\n1\\n\\nNl\\nLconf(yl, cl)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nHere, ys is the labels of all segments. y\\n(i)\\ns = 1 if the i-th\\n\\ndefault box is labeled as positive, and 0 otherwise. Like-\\nwise, yl is the labels of the links. Lconf is the softmax loss\\nover the predicted segment and link scores, respectively cs\\nand cl. Lloc is the Smooth L1 regression loss [4] over the\\npredicted segment geometries s\\xcc\\x82 and the groundtruth s. The\\nlosses on segment classification and regression are normal-\\nized by Ns, which is the number of positive default boxes.\\nThe loss on link classification is normalized by the number\\nof positive links Nl. The weight constants \\xce\\xbb1 and \\xce\\xbb2 are\\nboth set to 1 in practice.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Hard Negative Mining For both segments and\\nlinks, negatives take up most of the training samples. There-\\nfore, hard negative mining is necessary for balancing the\\npositive and negative samples. We follow the online hard\\nnegative mining strategy proposed in [20] to keep the ra-\\ntio between the negatives and positives 3:1 at most. Hard\\nnegative mining is performed separately for segments and\\nlinks.\\n\\nData Augmentation We adopt an online augmentation\\npipeline that is similar to that of SSD [14] and YOLO [18].\\nTraining images are randomly cropped to a patch that has a\\nminimum Jaccard overlap of o with any groundtruth word\\nCrops are resized to the same size before loaded into a\\nbatch. For oriented text, the augmentation is performed on\\nthe axis-aligned bounding boxes of the words. The overlap\\no is randomly chosen from 0 (no constraint), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\\n0.7, and 0.9 for every sample. The crop size is randomly\\nchosen from [0.1, 1] of the original image size. Training\\nimages are not horizontally flipped.\\n\\n5. Experiments\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate the proposed method on three\\npublic datasets, namely ICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (Chal-\\nlenge 4), MSRA-TD500, and ICDAR 2013, using the stan-\\ndard evaluation protocol of each.\\n\\n5.1. Datasets\\n\\nSynthText in the Wild (SynthText) [6] contains 800,000\\nsynthetic training images. They are created by blending nat-\\nural images with text rendered with random fonts, size, ori-\\nentation, and color. Text is rendered and aligned to care-\\nfully chosen image regions in order have a realistic look.\\nThe dataset provides very detailed annotations for charac-\\nters, words, and text lines. We only use the dataset for pre-\\ntraining our network.\\n\\nICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (IC15) [12] is the Chal-\\nlenge 4 of the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition.\\nThis challenge features incidental scene text images taken\\nby Google Glasses without taking care of positioning, im-\\nage quality, and viewpoint. Consequently, the dataset ex-\\nhibits large variations in text orientation, scale, and res-\\nolution, making it much more difficult than previous IC-\\nDAR challenges. The dataset contains 1000 training images\\nand 500 testing images. Annotations are provided as word\\nquadrilaterals.\\n\\nMSRA-TD500 (TD500) [25] is the first standard dataset\\nthat focuses on oriented text. The dataset is also multi-\\nlingual, including both Chinese and English text. The\\n\\ndataset consists of 300 training images and 200 testing im-\\nages. Different from IC15, TD500 is annotated at the level\\nof text lines.\\n\\nICDAR 2013 (IC13) [13] contains mostly horizontal text,\\nwith some text slightly oriented. The dataset has been\\nwidely adopted for evaluating text detection methods pre-\\nviously. It consists of 229 training images and 233 testing\\nimages.\\n\\n5.2. Implementation Details\\n\\nOur network is pre-trained on SynthText and finetuned\\non real datasets (specified later). It is optimized by the stan-\\ndard SGD algorithm with a momentum of 0.9. For both pre-\\ntraining and finetuning, images are resized to 384\\xc3\\x97384 after\\nrandom cropping. Since our model is fully-convolutional,\\nwe can train it on a certain size and apply it to other sizes\\nduring testing. Batch size is set to 32. In pretraining, the\\nlearning is set to 10\\xe2\\x88\\x923 for the first 60k iterations, then de-\\ncayed to 10\\xe2\\x88\\x924 for the rest 30k iterations. During finetuning,\\nthe learning rate is fixed to 10\\xe2\\x88\\x924 for 5-10k iterations. The\\nnumber of finetuning iterations depends on the size of the\\ndataset.\\n\\nDue to the precision-recall tradeoff and the difference\\nbetween evaluation protocols across datasets, we choose\\nthe best thresholds \\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\xb2 to optimize f-measure. Except\\nfor IC15, the thresholds are chosen separately on different\\ndatasets via a grid search with 0.1 step on a hold-out vali-\\ndation set. IC15 does not offer an offline evaluation script,\\nso the only way for us is to submit multiple results to the\\nevaluation server.\\n\\nOur method is implemented using TensorFlow [1] r0.11.\\nAll the experiments are carried out on a workstation with\\nan Intel Xeon 8-core CPU (2.8 GHz), 4 Titan X Graphics\\nCards, and 64GB RAM. Running on 4 GPUs in parallel,\\ntraining a batch takes about 0.5s. The whole training pro-\\ncess takes less than a day.\\n\\n5.3. Detecting Oriented English Text\\n\\nFirst, we evaluate SegLink on IC15. The pretrained\\nmodel is finetuned for 10k iterations on the training dataset\\nof IC15. Testing images are resized to 1280 \\xc3\\x97 768. We set\\nthe thresholds on segments and links to 0.9 and 0.7, respec-\\ntively. Performance is evaluated by the official central sub-\\nmission server (http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4).\\nIn order to meet the requirements on submission format, the\\noutput oriented rectangles are converted into quadrilaterals.\\n\\nTable 1 lists and compares the results of the proposed\\nmethod and other state-of-the-art methods. Some results are\\nobtained from the online leaderboard. SegLink outperforms\\nthe others by a large margin. In terms of f-measure, it out-\\nperforms the second best by 10.2%. Considering that some\\nmethods have close or even higher precision than SegLink,\\n\\nhttp://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4\\n\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=0.86    F-Score=0.92 Recall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0 Recall=0.88    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.88\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.93\\n\\nRecall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0\\n\\nFigure 6.

In addition, owing to its explicit link\\nprediction, SegLink correctly separates words that are very\\nclose to each other.\\n\\n5.4. Detecting Multi-Lingual Text in Long Lines\\n\\nWe further demonstrate the ability of SegLink to detect\\nlong text in non-Latin scripts. TD500 is taken as the dataset\\nfor this experiment, as it consists of oriented and multi-\\nlingual text. The training set of TD500 only has 300 im-\\nages, which are not enough for finetuning our model. We\\nmix the training set of TD500 with the training set of IC15,\\nin the way that every batch has half of its images coming\\nfrom each dataset. The pretrained model is finetuned for 8k\\niterations. The testing images are resized to 768\\xc3\\x97768. The\\nthresholds \\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\xb2 are set to 0.9 and 0.5 respectively. Per-\\nformance scores are calculated by the official development\\ntoolkit.\\n\\nAccording to Table 2, SegLink achieves the highest\\nscores in terms of precision and f-measure. Benefiting from\\nits fully-convolutional design, SegLink runs at 8.9 FPS, a\\n\\nTable 2. Results on MSRA-TD500\\n\\nMethod Precision Recall F-measure FPS\\nKang et al. [11] 71 62 66 -\\nYao et al.

The inference process of SegLink is a single forward\\npass in the detection network, while the previous methods\\n[25, 28, 30] involve sophisticated rule-based grouping or fil-\\ntering steps.\\n\\nTD500 contains many long lines of text in mixed lan-\\nguages (English and Chinese). Fig. 7 shows how SegLink\\nhandles such text. As can be seen, segments and links are\\ndensely detected along text lines. They result in long bound-\\ning boxes that are hard to obtain from a conventional ob-\\nject detector. Despite the large difference in appearance be-\\ntween English and Chinese text, SegLink is able to handle\\nthem simultaneously without any modifications in its struc-\\nture.\\n\\n5.5. Detecting Horizontal Text\\n\\nLastly, we evaluate the performance of SegLink on\\nhorizontal-text datasets. The pretrained model is finetuned\\nfor 5k iterations on the combined training sets of IC13 and\\nIC15. Since the most text in IC13 has relatively larger sizes,\\nthe testing images are resized to 512\\xc3\\x97 512. The thresholds\\n\\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\xb2 are set to 0.6 and 0.3, respectively. To match the\\nsubmission format, we convert the detected oriented boxes\\n\\n\\n\\nSe\\ngm\\n\\nen\\nts\\n\\n an\\nd\\n\\nLin\\nks\\n\\nCo\\nm\\n\\nbi\\nne\\n\\nd\\n\\nFigure 7.

The scores are calculated by the central sub-\\nmission system using the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeteval\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evaluation protocol.\\nSegLink achieves very competitive results in terms of f-\\nmeasure. Only one approach [22] outperforms SegLink in\\nterms of f-measure. However, [22] is mainly designed for\\ndetecting horizontal text and is not well-suited for oriented\\ntext. In terms of speed, SegLink runs at over 20 FPS on\\n512\\xc3\\x97 512 images, much faster than the other methods.\\n\\nTable 3. Results on IC13.

In practice, the optimal\\nvalues of the thresholds are found by a grid search. Sim-\\nplifying the parameters would be part of our future work.\\nAnother weakness is that SegLink fails to detect text that\\nhas very large character spacing. Fig. 8.a,b show two such\\ncases. The detected links connect adjacent segments but fail\\nto link distant segments.\\n\\n(a) (b) (c)\\n\\nFigure 8. Failure cases on TD500. Red boxes are false posi-\\ntives. (a)(b) SegLink fails to link the characters with large char-\\nacter spacing. (c) SegLink fails to detect curved text.\\n\\nFig. 8.c shows that SegLink fails to detect text of curved\\nshape. However, we believe that this is not a limitation of\\nthe segment linking strategy, but the segment combination\\nalgorithm, which can only produce rectangles currently.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented SegLink, a novel text detection strat-\\negy implemented by a simple and highly-efficient CNN\\nmodel. The superior performance on horizontal, ori-\\nented, and multi-lingual text datasets well demonstrate that\\nSegLink is accurate, fast, and flexible. In the future, we\\nwill further explore its potentials on detecting deformed text\\nsuch as curved text. Also, we are interested in extending\\nSegLink into a end-to-end recognition system.\\n\\nAcknowledgment\\n\\nThis work was supported in part by National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China (61222308 and 61573160),\\na Google Focused Research Award, AWS Cloud Credits\\nfor Research, a Microsoft Research Award and a Facebook\\nequipment donation.

We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decom- pose text into two locally detectable elements, namely seg- ments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering a part of a word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining seg- ments connected by links. Compared with previous meth- ods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75.0% on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512×512 images. More- over, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.  1. Introduction  Reading text in natural images is a challenging task un- der active research. It is driven by many real-world appli- cations, such as Photo OCR [2], geo-location, and image retrieval [9]. In a text reading system, text detection, i.e. localizing text with bounding boxes of words or text lines, is usually the first step of great significance. In a sense, text detection can be seen as object detection applied to text, where words/characters/text lines are taken as the detection targets. Owing to this, a new trend has emerged recently that state-of-the-art text detection methods [9, 6, 22, 30] are heavily based on the advanced general object detection or segmentation techniques, e.g. [4, 5, 15].  Despite the great success of the previous work, we ar- gue that the general detection methods are not well suited  ∗Corresponding author.  (a) (b) (c)  (d) (e) (f)  Figure 1. SegLink Overview. The upper row shows an image with two words of different scales and orientations. (a) Segments (yellow boxes) are detected on the image.

(d-f) SegLink is able to detect long lines of Latin and non-Latin text, such as Chinese.  for text detection, for two main reasons. First, word/text line bounding boxes have much larger aspect ratios than those of general objects. An (fast/faster) R-CNN [5, 4, 19]- or SSD [14]-style detector may suffer from the difficulty of producing such boxes, owing to its proposal or anchor box design. In addition, some non-Latin text does not have blank spaces between words, hence the even larger bound- ing box aspect ratios, which make the problem worse. Sec- ond, unlike general objects, text usually has a clear defini- tion of orientation [25]. It is important for a text detector to produce oriented boxes. However, most general object de- tection methods are not designed to produce oriented boxes.  To overcome the above challenges, we tackle the text de- tection problem in a new perspective. We propose to de- compose long text into two smaller and locally-detectable elements, namely segment and link. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a segment is an oriented box that covers a part of a word  ar X  iv :1  70 3.  06 52  0v 3    [ cs  .C V  ]   1  3  A  pr  2  01 7    64  512  VGG16  through  pool5  conv 4_3  Input Image (512x512)  32  1024  conv7 (fc7)  16  1024  conv 8_2  8  512  conv 9_2 conv  10_24 conv11  Combining  Segments  Detections  256  2  256  𝑙 = 1 𝑙 = 6𝑙 = 2 𝑙 = 3 𝑙 = 4 𝑙 = 5  3x3 conv  predictors  1024,k3s1 1024,k1s1  256,k1s1 512,k3s2  128,k1s1 256,k3s2  128,k1s1 256,k3s2  256,k3s2  Figure 2. Network Architecture. The network consists of convolutional feature layers (shown as gray blocks) and convolutional predictors (thin gray arrows). Convolutional filters are specified in the format of “(#filters),k(kernel size)s(stride)”. A multi-line filter specification means a hidden layer between. Segments (yellow boxes) and links (not displayed) are detected by convolutional predictors on multiple feature layers (indexed by l = 1 . . . 6) and combined into whole words by a combining algorithm.  (for clarity we use “word” here and later on, but segments also work seamlessly on text lines that comprise multiple words); A link connects a pair of adjacent segments, indi- cating that they belong to the same word. Under the above definitions, a word is located by a number of segments with links between them. During detection, segments and links are densely detected on an input image by a convo- lutional neural network. Then, the segments are combined into whole words according to the links.  The key advantage of this approach is that long and ori- ented text is now detected locally since both basic elements are locally-detectable: Detecting a segment does not require the whole word to be observed. And neither does a link since the connection of two segments can be inferred from a local context. Thereafter, we can detect text of any length and orientation with great flexibility and efficiency.  Concretely, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect both segments and links simultane- ously, in a fully-convolutional manner. The network uses VGG-16 [21] as its backbone. A few extra feature lay- ers are added onto it. Convolutional predictors are added to 6 of the feature layers to detect segments and links at different scales. To deal with redundant detections, we in- troduce two types of links, namely within-layer links and cross-layer links. A within-layer link connects a segment to its neighbors on the same layer. A cross-layer link, on the other hand, connects a segment to its neighbors on the lower layer. In this way, we connect segments of adjacent locations as well as scales. Finally, we find connected seg- ments with a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and com- bine them into whole words.  Our main contribution is the novel segment-linking de-  tection method. Through experiments, we show that the proposed method possesses several distinctive advantages over the other state-of-the-art methods: 1) Robustness: SegLink models the structure of oriented text in a simple and elegant way, with robustness against complex back- grounds. Our method achieves highly competitive results on standard datasets. In particular, it outperforms the previ- ous best by a large margin in terms of f-measure (75.0% vs 64.8%) on the ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) bench- mark [12]; 2) Efficiency: SegLink is highly efficient due to its single-pass, fully-convolutional design. It processes more than 20 images of 512x512 size per second; 3) Gener- ality: Without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. We demonstrate this capability on a multi-lingual dataset.  2. Related Work  Text Detection Over the past few years, much research effort has been devoted to the text detection problem [24, 23, 17, 17, 25, 7, 8, 30, 29, 2, 9, 6, 22, 26]. Based on the ba- sic detection targets, the previous methods can be roughly divided into three categories: character-based, word-based and line-based. Character-based methods [17, 23, 24, 10, 7, 8] detect individual characters and group them into words. These methods find characters by classifying candidate re- gions extracted by region extraction algorithms or by classi- fying sliding windows. Such methods often involve a post- processing step of grouping characters into words. Word- based methods [9, 6] directly detect word bounding boxes. They often have a similar pipeline to the recent CNN-based general object detection networks. Though achieving ex- cellent detection accuracies, these methods may suffer from    performance drop when applied to some non-Latin text such as Chinese, as we mentioned earlier. Line-based meth- ods [29, 30, 26] find text regions using some image seg- mentation algorithms. They also require a sophisticated post-processing step of word partitioning and/or false pos- itive removal. Compared with the previous approaches, our method predicts segments and links jointly in a single forward network pass. The pipeline is much simpler and cleaner. Moreover, the network is end-to-end trainable.  Our method is similar in spirit to a recent work [22], which detects text lines by finding and grouping a sequence of fine-scale text proposals through a CNN coupled with recurrent neural layers. In contrast, we detect oriented seg- ments only using convolutional layers, yielding better flexi- bility and faster speed. Also, we detect links explicitly using the same strong CNN features for segments, improving the robustness.  Object Detection Text detection can be seen as a partic- ular instance of general object detection, which is a funda- mental problem in computer vision. Most state-of-the-art detection systems either classify some class-agnostic ob- ject proposals with CNN [5, 4, 19] or directly regress ob- ject bounding boxes from a set of preset boxes (e.g. anchor boxes) [18, 14].  The architecture of our network inherits that of SSD [14], a recent object detection model. SSD proposed the idea of detecting objects on multiple feature layers with convolu- tional predictors. Our model also detects segments and links in a very similar way. Despite the model similarity, our de- tection strategy is drastically different: SSD directly out- puts object bounding boxes. We, on the other hand, adopt a bottom-up approach by detecting the two comprising ele- ments of a word or text line and combine them together.  3. Segment Linking Our method detects text with a feed-forward CNN  model. Given an input image I of size wI × hI , the model outputs a fixed number of segments and links, which are then filtered by their confidence scores and combined into whole word bounding boxes. A bounding box is a ro- tated rectangle denoted by b = (xb, yb, wb, hb, θb), where xb, yb are the coordinates of the center, wb, hb the width and height, and θb the rotation angle.  3.1. CNN Model  Fig. 2 shows the network architecture. Our network uses a pretrained VGG-16 network [21] as its backbone (conv1 through pool5). Following [14], the fully-connected layers of VGG-16 are converted into convolutional layers (fc6 to conv6; fc7 to conv7). They are followed by a few extra con- volutional layers (conv8 1 to conv11), which extract even  deeper features with larger receptive fields. Their configu- rations are specified in Fig. 2.  Segments and links are detected on 6 of the feature lay- ers, which are conv4 3, conv7, conv8 2, conv9 2, conv10 2, and conv11. These feature layers provide high-quality deep features of different granularity (conv4 3 the finest and conv11 the coarsest). A convolutional predictor with 3 × 3 kernels is added to each of the 6 layers to detect segments and links. We index the feature layers and the predictors by l = 1, . . . , 6.  Segment Detection Segments are also oriented boxes, de- noted by s = (xs, ys, ws, hs, θs). We detect segments by estimating the confidence scores and geometric offsets to a set of default boxes [14] on the input image. Each default box is associated with a feature map location, and its score and offsets are predicted from the features at that location. For simplicity, we only associate one default box with a fea- ture map location.  Consider the l-th feature layer whose feature map size is wl × hl. A location (x, y) on this map corresponds to a default box centered at (xa, ya) on the image, where  xa = wI wl  (x+ 0.5); ya = hI hl  (y + 0.5) (1)  The width and height of the default box are both set to a constant al.  The convolutional predictor produces 7 channels for segment detection. Among them, 2 channels are further softmax-normalized to get the segment score in (0, 1). The rest 5 are the geometric offsets. Considering a location (x, y) on the map, we denote the vector at this location along the depth by (∆xs, ∆ys, ∆ws, ∆hs, ∆θs). Then, the segment at this location is calculated by:  xs = al∆xs + xa (2) ys = al∆ys + ya (3) ws = al exp(∆ws) (4) hs = al exp(∆hs) (5) θs = ∆θs (6)  Here, the constant al controls the scale of the output seg- ments. It should be chosen with regard to the receptive field size of the l-th layer. We use an empirical equation for choosing this size: al = γ wIwl , where γ = 1.5.  Within-Layer Link Detection A link connects a pair of adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word. Here, adjacent segments are those detected at adja- cent feature map locations. Links are not only necessary for combining segments into whole words but also helpful for separating two nearby words – between two nearby words, the links should be predicted as negative.

(a) A location on conv8 2 (yellow block) and its 8-connected neighbors (blue blocks with and without fill). The detected within-layer links (green lines) connect a segment (yellow box) and its two neigh- boring segments (blue boxes) on the same layer. (b) The cross- layer links connect a segment on conv9 2 (yellow box) and two segments on conv8 2 (blue boxes).  We explicitly detect links between segments using the same features for detecting segments. Since we detect only one segment at a feature map location, segments can be indexed by their map locations (x, y) and layer indexes l, denoted by s(x,y,l). As illustrated in Fig. 3.a, we define the within-layer neighbors of a segment as its 8-connected neighbors on the same feature layer:  Nws(x,y,l) = {s (x′,y′,l)}x−1≤x′≤x+1,y−1≤y′≤y+1 \\\\ s(x,y,l)  (7)  As segments are detected locally, a pair of neighboring seg- ments are also adjacent on input image. Links are also de- tected by the convolutional predictors. A predictor outputs 16 channels for the links to the 8-connected neighboring segments. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to get the score of a link.  Cross-Layer Link Detection In our network, segments are detected at different scales on different feature layers. Each layer handles a range of scales. We make these ranges overlap in order not to miss scales at their edges. But as a result, segments of the same word could be detected on multiple layers at the same time, producing redundancies.  To address this problem, we further propose another type of links, called cross-layer links. A cross-layer link connects segments on two feature layers with adjacent in- dexes. For example, cross-layer links are detected between conv4 3 and conv7, because their indexes are l = 1 and l = 2 respectively.  An important property of such a pair is that the first layer always has twice the size as the second one, because of the  down-sampling layer (max-pooling or stride-2 convolution) between them. Note that this property only holds when all feature layers have even-numbered sizes. In practice, we ensured this property by having the width and height of the input image both dividable by 128. For example, an 1000× 800 image is resized to 1024 × 768, which is the nearest valid size.  As illustrated in Fig. 3.b, we define the cross-layer neighbors of a segment as  (8)N cs(x,y,l) = {s (x′,y′,l−1)}2x≤x′≤2x+1,2y≤y′≤2y+1,  which are the segments on the preceeding layer. Every seg- ment has 4 cross-layer neighbors. The correspondence is ensured by the double-size relationship between the two layers.  Again, cross-layer links are detected by the convolu- tional predictor. The predictor outputs 8 channels for cross- layer links. Every 2 channels are softmax-normalized to produce the score of a cross-layer link. Cross-layer links are detected on feature layer l = 2 . . . 6, but not on l = 1 (conv4 3) since it has no preceeding feature layer.  With cross-layer links, segments of different scales can be connected and later combined. Compared with the tradi- tional non-maximum suppression, cross-layer linking pro- vides a trainable way of joining redundancies. Besides, it fits seamlessly into our linking strategy and is easy to im- plement under our framework.  segment  scores  segment  offsets  within-layer  link scores  cross-layer  link scores  2 5 16 8 𝑤\"  ℎ\"  Figure 4.

Outputs of a Convolutional Predictor Putting things to- gether, Fig. 4 shows the output channels of a convolutional predictor. A predictor is implemented by a convolutional layer followed by some softmax layers that normalize the segment and link scores respectively. Thereafter, all lay- ers in our network are convolutional layers. Our network is fully-convolutional.  3.2. Combining Segments with Links  After feed-forwarding, the network produces a number of segments and links (the number depends on the image size). Before combination, the output segments and links are filtered by their confidence scores. We set different fil- tering thresholds for segment and link, respectively α and β.    Empirically, the performance of our model is not very sensi- tive to these thresholds. A 0.1 deviation on either thresholds from their optimal values results in less than 1% f-measure drop.  Taking the filtered segments as nodes and the filtered links as edges, we construct a graph over them. Then, a depth-first search (DFS) is performed over the graph to find its connected components. Each component contains a set of segments that are connected by links. Denoting a con- nected component by B, segments within this component are combined following the procedures in Alg. 1.  Algorithm 1 Combining Segments  1: Input: B = {s(i)}|B|i=1 is a set of segments connected by links, where s(i) = (x(i)s , y  (i) s , w  (i) s , h  (i) s , θ  (i) s ).  2: Find the average angle θb := 1|B| ∑ B θ  (i) s .  3: For a straight line (tan θb)x + b, find the b that min- imizes the sum of distances to all segment centers (x  (i) s , y  (i) s ).  4: Find the perpendicular projections of all segment cen- ters onto the straight line.  5: From the projected points, find the two with the longest distance. Denote them by (xp, yp) and (xq, yq).  6: xb := 1 2 (xp + xq)  7: yb := 1 2 (yp + yq)  8: wb := √  (xp − xq)2 + (yp − yq)2 + 12 (wp + wq) 9: hb :=  1 |B|  ∑ B h  (i) s  10: b := (xb, yb, wb, hb, θb)  11: Output: b is the combined bounding box.  4. Training 4.1. Groundtruths of Segments and Links  The network is trained by the direct supervision of groundtruth segments and links. The groundtruths include the labels of all default boxes (i.e. the label of their corre- sponding segments), their offsets to the default boxes, and the labels of all within- and cross-layer links. We calculate them from the groundtruth word bounding boxes.  First, we assume that there is only one groundtruth word on the input image. A default box is labeled as positive iff 1) the center of the box is inside the word bounding box; 2) the ratio between the box size al and the word height h satisfies:  max( al h , h  al ) ≤ 1.5 (9)  Otherwise, the default box is labeled as negative. Next, we consider the case of multiple words. A default  box is labeled as negative if it does not meet the above- mentioned criteria for any word. Otherwise, it is labeled as  positive and matched to the word that has the closest size, i.e. the one with the minimal value at the left-hand side of Eq. 9.  word  bounding box  default box  box center  𝜃  (1) Default box, word bounding box, and  the center of the default box (blue dot)  (2) Rotate word clockwise by 𝜃 along  the center of the default box  (3) Crop word bounding box to remove  the parts to the left and right of the  default box  (4) Rotate the cropped box  anticlockwise by 𝜃 along the center of  the default box  𝑎  ℎ  𝑤% \\t groundtruth   segment  ℎ%\\t 𝑥%, 𝑦%  Figure 5. The steps of calculating a groundtruth segment given a default box and a word bounding box.  Offsets are calculated on positive default boxes. First, we calculate the groundtruth segments following the steps illustrated in Fig. 5. Then, we solve Eq. 2 to Eq. 6 to get the groundtruth offsets.  A link (either within-layer or cross-layer) is labeled as positive iff 1) both of the default boxes connected to it are labeled as positive; 2) the two default boxes are matched to the same word.  4.2. Optimization  Objective Our network model is trained by simultane- ously minimizing the losses on segment classification, off- sets regression, and link classification. Overall, the loss function is a weighted sum of the three losses:  L(ys, cs,yl, cl, ŝ, s) = 1  Ns Lconf(ys, cs)+λ1  1  Ns Lloc(ŝ, s)  + λ2 1  Nl Lconf(yl, cl)  (10)  Here, ys is the labels of all segments. y (i) s = 1 if the i-th  default box is labeled as positive, and 0 otherwise. Like- wise, yl is the labels of the links. Lconf is the softmax loss over the predicted segment and link scores, respectively cs and cl. Lloc is the Smooth L1 regression loss [4] over the predicted segment geometries ŝ and the groundtruth s. The losses on segment classification and regression are normal- ized by Ns, which is the number of positive default boxes. The loss on link classification is normalized by the number of positive links Nl. The weight constants λ1 and λ2 are both set to 1 in practice.    Online Hard Negative Mining For both segments and links, negatives take up most of the training samples. There- fore, hard negative mining is necessary for balancing the positive and negative samples. We follow the online hard negative mining strategy proposed in [20] to keep the ra- tio between the negatives and positives 3:1 at most. Hard negative mining is performed separately for segments and links.  Data Augmentation We adopt an online augmentation pipeline that is similar to that of SSD [14] and YOLO [18]. Training images are randomly cropped to a patch that has a minimum Jaccard overlap of o with any groundtruth word Crops are resized to the same size before loaded into a batch. For oriented text, the augmentation is performed on the axis-aligned bounding boxes of the words. The overlap o is randomly chosen from 0 (no constraint), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 for every sample. The crop size is randomly chosen from [0.1, 1] of the original image size. Training images are not horizontally flipped.  5. Experiments  In this section, we evaluate the proposed method on three public datasets, namely ICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (Chal- lenge 4), MSRA-TD500, and ICDAR 2013, using the stan- dard evaluation protocol of each.  5.1. Datasets  SynthText in the Wild (SynthText) [6] contains 800,000 synthetic training images. They are created by blending nat- ural images with text rendered with random fonts, size, ori- entation, and color. Text is rendered and aligned to care- fully chosen image regions in order have a realistic look. The dataset provides very detailed annotations for charac- ters, words, and text lines. We only use the dataset for pre- training our network.  ICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (IC15) [12] is the Chal- lenge 4 of the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition. This challenge features incidental scene text images taken by Google Glasses without taking care of positioning, im- age quality, and viewpoint. Consequently, the dataset ex- hibits large variations in text orientation, scale, and res- olution, making it much more difficult than previous IC- DAR challenges. The dataset contains 1000 training images and 500 testing images. Annotations are provided as word quadrilaterals.  MSRA-TD500 (TD500) [25] is the first standard dataset that focuses on oriented text. The dataset is also multi- lingual, including both Chinese and English text. The  dataset consists of 300 training images and 200 testing im- ages. Different from IC15, TD500 is annotated at the level of text lines.  ICDAR 2013 (IC13) [13] contains mostly horizontal text, with some text slightly oriented. The dataset has been widely adopted for evaluating text detection methods pre- viously. It consists of 229 training images and 233 testing images.  5.2. Implementation Details  Our network is pre-trained on SynthText and finetuned on real datasets (specified later). It is optimized by the stan- dard SGD algorithm with a momentum of 0.9. For both pre- training and finetuning, images are resized to 384×384 after random cropping. Since our model is fully-convolutional, we can train it on a certain size and apply it to other sizes during testing. Batch size is set to 32. In pretraining, the learning is set to 10−3 for the first 60k iterations, then de- cayed to 10−4 for the rest 30k iterations. During finetuning, the learning rate is fixed to 10−4 for 5-10k iterations. The number of finetuning iterations depends on the size of the dataset.  Due to the precision-recall tradeoff and the difference between evaluation protocols across datasets, we choose the best thresholds α and β to optimize f-measure. Except for IC15, the thresholds are chosen separately on different datasets via a grid search with 0.1 step on a hold-out vali- dation set. IC15 does not offer an offline evaluation script, so the only way for us is to submit multiple results to the evaluation server.  Our method is implemented using TensorFlow [1] r0.11. All the experiments are carried out on a workstation with an Intel Xeon 8-core CPU (2.8 GHz), 4 Titan X Graphics Cards, and 64GB RAM. Running on 4 GPUs in parallel, training a batch takes about 0.5s. The whole training pro- cess takes less than a day.  5.3. Detecting Oriented English Text  First, we evaluate SegLink on IC15. The pretrained model is finetuned for 10k iterations on the training dataset of IC15. Testing images are resized to 1280 × 768. We set the thresholds on segments and links to 0.9 and 0.7, respec- tively. Performance is evaluated by the official central sub- mission server (http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4). In order to meet the requirements on submission format, the output oriented rectangles are converted into quadrilaterals.  Table 1 lists and compares the results of the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods. Some results are obtained from the online leaderboard. SegLink outperforms the others by a large margin. In terms of f-measure, it out- performs the second best by 10.2%. Considering that some methods have close or even higher precision than SegLink,  http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4   Recall=1.0    Precision=0.86    F-Score=0.92 Recall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0  Recall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0 Recall=0.88    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.88  Recall=1.0    Precision=0.88    F-Score=0.93  Recall=1.0    Precision=1.0    F-Score=1.0  Figure 6. Example Results on IC15. Green regions are correctly detected text regions. Red ones are either false positive or false negative. Gray ones are detected but neglected by the evaluation algorithm. Visualizations are generated by the central submission system. Yellow frames contain zoom-in image regions.  Table 1.

[26] 72.3 58.7 64.8 SegLink 73.1 76.8 75.0  the improvement mainly comes from the recall. As shown in Fig. 6, our method is able to distinguish text from very cluttered backgrounds. In addition, owing to its explicit link prediction, SegLink correctly separates words that are very close to each other.  5.4. Detecting Multi-Lingual Text in Long Lines  We further demonstrate the ability of SegLink to detect long text in non-Latin scripts. TD500 is taken as the dataset for this experiment, as it consists of oriented and multi- lingual text. The training set of TD500 only has 300 im- ages, which are not enough for finetuning our model. We mix the training set of TD500 with the training set of IC15, in the way that every batch has half of its images coming from each dataset. The pretrained model is finetuned for 8k iterations. The testing images are resized to 768×768. The thresholds α and β are set to 0.9 and 0.5 respectively. Per- formance scores are calculated by the official development toolkit.  According to Table 2, SegLink achieves the highest scores in terms of precision and f-measure. Benefiting from its fully-convolutional design, SegLink runs at 8.9 FPS, a  Table 2.

The inference process of SegLink is a single forward pass in the detection network, while the previous methods [25, 28, 30] involve sophisticated rule-based grouping or fil- tering steps.  TD500 contains many long lines of text in mixed lan- guages (English and Chinese). Fig. 7 shows how SegLink handles such text. As can be seen, segments and links are densely detected along text lines. They result in long bound- ing boxes that are hard to obtain from a conventional ob- ject detector. Despite the large difference in appearance be- tween English and Chinese text, SegLink is able to handle them simultaneously without any modifications in its struc- ture.  5.5. Detecting Horizontal Text  Lastly, we evaluate the performance of SegLink on horizontal-text datasets. The pretrained model is finetuned for 5k iterations on the combined training sets of IC13 and IC15. Since the most text in IC13 has relatively larger sizes, the testing images are resized to 512× 512. The thresholds α and β are set to 0.6 and 0.3, respectively. To match the submission format, we convert the detected oriented boxes    Se gm  en ts   an d  Lin ks  Co m  bi ne  d  Figure 7. Example Results on TD500. The first row shows the detected segments and links. The within-layer and cross-layer links are visualized as red and green lines, respectively. Segments are shown as rectangles in different colors, denoting different connected components. The second row shows the combined boxes.  into their axis-aligned bounding boxes. Table 3 compares SegLink with other state-of-the-art  methods. The scores are calculated by the central sub- mission system using the “Deteval” evaluation protocol. SegLink achieves very competitive results in terms of f- measure. Only one approach [22] outperforms SegLink in terms of f-measure. However, [22] is mainly designed for detecting horizontal text and is not well-suited for oriented text. In terms of speed, SegLink runs at over 20 FPS on 512× 512 images, much faster than the other methods.  Table 3. Results on IC13. P, R, F stand for precision, recall and f-measure respectively. *These methods are only evaluated under the “ICDAR 2013” evaluation protocol, the rest under “Deteval”. The two protocols usually yield very close scores.  Method P R F FPS Neumann et al. [16]∗ 81.8 72.4 77.1 3 Neumann et al. [17]∗ 82.1 71.3 76.3 3 Busta et al. [3]∗ 84.0 69.3 76.8 6 Zhang et al.

Limitations  A major limitation of SegLink is that two thresholds, α and β, need to be set manually. In practice, the optimal values of the thresholds are found by a grid search. Sim- plifying the parameters would be part of our future work. Another weakness is that SegLink fails to detect text that has very large character spacing. Fig. 8.a,b show two such cases. The detected links connect adjacent segments but fail to link distant segments.  (a) (b) (c)  Figure 8. Failure cases on TD500. Red boxes are false posi- tives. (a)(b) SegLink fails to link the characters with large char- acter spacing. (c) SegLink fails to detect curved text.  Fig. 8.c shows that SegLink fails to detect text of curved shape. However, we believe that this is not a limitation of the segment linking strategy, but the segment combination algorithm, which can only produce rectangles currently.  6. Conclusion  We have presented SegLink, a novel text detection strat- egy implemented by a simple and highly-efficient CNN model. The superior performance on horizontal, ori- ented, and multi-lingual text datasets well demonstrate that SegLink is accurate, fast, and flexible. In the future, we will further explore its potentials on detecting deformed text such as curved text. Also, we are interested in extending SegLink into a end-to-end recognition system.
