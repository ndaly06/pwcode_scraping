Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspecific architecture modifications.\\n\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce fine-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\n\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-specific parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\n\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the fine-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying fine-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\n\\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\n\\nar\\nX\\n\\niv\\n:1\\n\\n81\\n0.\\n\\n04\\n80\\n\\n5v\\n2 \\n\\n [\\ncs\\n\\n.C\\nL\\n\\n] \\n 2\\n\\n4 \\nM\\n\\nay\\n 2\\n\\n01\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\nword based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspecific architectures. BERT is the first fine-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-specific architectures.\\n\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we briefly review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering significant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\n\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\n\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-specific architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\n\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\n\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nfine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and fine-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During fine-tuning, all parameters are fine-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\n\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\n\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to fine-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n\\n3 BERT\\n\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and fine-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For fine-\\ntuning, the BERT model is first initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate fine-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\n\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\n\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the final downstream architecture.\\n\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\n\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH , and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\n\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\n\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n\\n1https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/filter size to be 4H ,\\n\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\n\\n\\n\\nInput/Output Representations To make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., 〈Question, Answer 〉) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\n\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classification\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the final hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH ,\\nand the final hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈ RH .\\n\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\n\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\n\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\n\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\n\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\n\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nfine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\n\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n\\n5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\n\\nwithout fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CLS] he likes play ##ing [SEP]my dog is cute [SEP]Input\\n\\nE[CLS] Ehe Elikes Eplay E##ing E[SEP]Emy Edog Eis Ecute E[SEP]\\nToken\\nEmbeddings\\n\\nEA EB EB EB EB EBEA EA EA EA EA\\nSegment\\nEmbeddings\\n\\nE0 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10E1 E2 E3 E4 E5\\nPosition\\nEmbeddings\\n\\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\n\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\n\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\n\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\n\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classification, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\n\\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\\nscribe the task-specific details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n\\n4 Experiments\\n\\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\n\\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the final hid-\\nden vector C ∈ RH corresponding to the first\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nfine-tuning are classification layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H , whereK is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classification loss with C and W ,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\\n\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\n\\nhttps://gluebenchmark.com/faq\\n\\n\\nSystem MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Average\\n392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k -\\n\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0\\nOpenAI GPT 82.1/81.4 70.3 87.4 91.3 45.4 80.0 82.3 56.0 75.1\\nBERTBASE 84.6/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6\\nBERTLARGE 86.7/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1\\n\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different\\nthan the official GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\\n\\nWe use a batch size of 32 and fine-tune for 3\\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\\ntask, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate\\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\\nAdditionally, for BERTLARGE we found that fine-\\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\\nform different fine-tuning data shuffling and clas-\\nsifier layer initialization.9\\n\\nResults are presented in Table 1.

For the largest and most widely\\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the official\\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score\\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\\n\\nWe find that BERTLARGE significantly outper-\\nforms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those\\nwith very little training data. The effect of model\\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\\n\\n4.2 SQuAD v1.1\\n\\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset\\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\\nsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\\n2016). Given a question and a passage from\\n\\n9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test\\nlabels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server\\nsubmission for each of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE.\\n\\n10https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\n\\nWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\\ntion using the A embedding and the passage using\\nthe B embedding. We only introduce a start vec-\\ntor S ∈ RH and an end vector E ∈ RH during\\nfine-tuning. The probability of word i being the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi = e\\n\\nS·Ti∑\\nj e\\n\\nS·Tj .\\n\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\\nposition i to position j is defined as S·Ti + E·Tj ,\\nand the maximum scoring span where j ≥ i is\\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\\nend positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\\n\\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the\\nSQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public\\nsystem descriptions available,11 and are allowed to\\nuse any public data when training their systems.\\nWe therefore use modest data augmentation in\\nour system by first fine-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi\\net al., 2017) befor fine-tuning on SQuAD.\\n\\nOur best performing system outperforms the top\\nleaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and\\n+1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single\\nBERT model outperforms the top ensemble sys-\\ntem in terms of F1 score. Without TriviaQA fine-\\n\\n11QANet is described in Yu et al.

The probability space for the start and end\\nanswer span positions is extended to include the\\nposition of the [CLS] token.

Given a sen-\\ntence, the task is to choose the most plausible con-\\ntinuation among four choices.\\n\\nWhen fine-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we\\nconstruct four input sequences, each containing\\nthe concatenation of the given sentence (sentence\\nA) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The\\nonly task-specific parameters introduced is a vec-\\ntor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep-\\nresentation C denotes a score for each choice\\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\\n\\nWe fine-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Re-\\nsults are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGE out-\\nperforms the authors’ baseline ESIM+ELMo sys-\\ntem by +27.1% and OpenAI GPT by 8.3%.\\n\\n5 Ablation Studies\\n\\nIn this section, we perform ablation experiments\\nover a number of facets of BERT in order to better\\nunderstand their relative importance. Additional\\n\\n\\n\\nDev Set\\nTasks MNLI-m QNLI MRPC SST-2 SQuAD\\n\\n(Acc) (Acc) (Acc) (Acc) (F1)\\n\\nBERTBASE 84.4 88.4 86.7 92.7 88.5\\nNo NSP 83.9 84.9 86.5 92.6 87.9\\nLTR & No NSP 82.1 84.3 77.5 92.1 77.8\\n\\n+ BiLSTM 82.1 84.1 75.7 91.6 84.9\\n\\nTable 5: Ablation over the pre-training tasks using the\\nBERTBASE architecture. “No NSP” is trained without\\nthe next sentence prediction task. “LTR & No NSP” is\\ntrained as a left-to-right LM without the next sentence\\nprediction, like OpenAI GPT. “+ BiLSTM” adds a ran-\\ndomly initialized BiLSTM on top of the “LTR + No\\nNSP” model during fine-tuning.\\n\\nablation studies can be found in Appendix C.\\n\\n5.1 Effect of Pre-training Tasks\\n\\nWe demonstrate the importance of the deep bidi-\\nrectionality of BERT by evaluating two pre-\\ntraining objectives using exactly the same pre-\\ntraining data, fine-tuning scheme, and hyperpa-\\nrameters as BERTBASE:\\n\\nNo NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained\\nusing the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the\\n“next sentence prediction” (NSP) task.\\nLTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which\\nis trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)\\nLM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at fine-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\\n\\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\n\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsignificantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\n\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\n\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\n\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\n\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such significant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\n\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the first work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been suffi-\\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\\n\\n\\n\\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is fine-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspecific models can benefit from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\n\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe fine-tuning approach, where a simple classifi-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere fixed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-specific model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational benefits\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\n\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\\n\\nHyperparams Dev Set Accuracy\\n\\n#L #H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\\n\\n3 768 12 5.84 77.9 79.8 88.4\\n6 768 3 5.24 80.6 82.2 90.7\\n6 768 12 4.68 81.9 84.8 91.3\\n\\n12 768 12 3.99 84.4 86.7 92.9\\n12 1024 16 3.54 85.7 86.9 93.3\\n24 1024 16 3.23 86.6 87.8 93.7\\n\\nTable 6: Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the\\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of at-\\ntention heads. “LM (ppl)” is the masked LM perplexity\\nof held-out training data.\\n\\nSystem Dev F1 Test F1\\n\\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018a) 95.7 92.2\\nCVT (Clark et al., 2018) - 92.6\\nCSE (Akbik et al., 2018) - 93.1\\n\\nFine-tuning approach\\nBERTLARGE 96.6 92.8\\nBERTBASE 96.4 92.4\\n\\nFeature-based approach (BERTBASE)\\nEmbeddings 91.0 -\\nSecond-to-Last Hidden 95.6 -\\nLast Hidden 94.9 -\\nWeighted Sum Last Four Hidden 95.9 -\\nConcat Last Four Hidden 96.1 -\\nWeighted Sum All 12 Layers 95.5 -\\n\\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition re-\\nsults.

We use the representation of\\nthe first sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassifier over the NER label set.\\n\\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without fine-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\\nthe classification layer.\\n\\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE\\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\\n0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This\\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine-\\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\\npart of many language understanding systems. In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\\nizing these findings to deep bidirectional architec-\\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.\\n2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\n\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\n\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model\\n\\n\\n\\nBERT (Ours)\\n\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\nOpenAI GPT\\n\\nLstm\\n\\nELMo\\n\\nLstm Lstm\\n\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\n\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\n\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\n\\n T1 T2  TN...\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n E1 E2  EN...\\n\\n T1 T2 TN...\\n\\n E1 E2  EN...\\n\\n T1 T2  TN...\\n\\n E1 E2  EN...\\n\\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures.

In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\\n\\nNext Sentence Prediction The next sentence\\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\\nexamples.\\n\\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\\n\\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\\n\\nLabel = IsNext\\n\\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\\n\\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\\n\\nLabel = NotNext\\n\\nA.2 Pre-training Procedure\\n\\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\\nrefer to as “sentences” even though they are typ-\\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\\nbe shorter also). The first sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\n\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\n\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\n\\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\n\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\n\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\n\\nFor fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-specific, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n\\n• Batch size: 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\\n\\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\\navailability.html\\n\\n\\n\\n• Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\\n• Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4\\n\\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\\nperforms best on the development set.\\n\\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\\nOpenAI GPT\\n\\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fine-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\n\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and\\nclassifier token ([CLS]) which are only in-\\ntroduced at fine-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-specific fine-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.\\n\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\n\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\n\\nThe illustration of fine-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specific\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

       "' BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding Jacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova Google AI Language {jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com Abstract We introduce a new language representa- tion model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language repre- sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad- ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre- train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a re- sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine- tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task- specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re- sults on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer- ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im- provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement). 1 Introduction Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder, 2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re- lationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016). There are two existing strategies for apply- ing pre-trained language representations to down- stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as addi- tional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre- trained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations. We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, espe- cially for the fine-tuning approaches. The ma- jor limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi- tectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to- right architecture, where every token can only at- tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re- strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying fine- tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incor- porate context from both directions. In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi- rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan- guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in- spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked ar X iv :1 81 0. 04 80 5v 2 [ cs .C L ] 2 4 M ay 2 01 9 word based only on its context. Unlike left-to- right language model pre-training, the MLM ob- jective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre- train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi- tion to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre- trains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows: • We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Un- like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec- tional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pre- trained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs. • We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered task- specific architectures. BERT is the first fine- tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper- forming many task-specific architectures. • BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod- els are available at https://github.com/ google-research/bert. 2 Related Work There is a long history of pre-training general lan- guage representations, and we briefly review the most widely-used approaches in this section. 2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches Learning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, of- fering significant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre- train word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan- guage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis- criminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context (Mikolov et al., 2013). These approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embed- dings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen- tence words given a representation of the previous sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto- encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016). ELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017, 2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re- search along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual rep- resentation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations. When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques- tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to pre- dict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation mod- els. 2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches As with the feature-based approaches, the first works in this direction only pre-trained word em- bedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col- lobert and Weston, 2008). More recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and fine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai and Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches is that few parameters need to be learned from scratch. At least partly due to this advantage, OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre- viously state-of-the-art results on many sentence- level tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architec- tures are used in both pre-training and fine-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize models for different down-stream tasks. During fine-tuning, all parameters are fine-tuned. [CLS] is a special symbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques- tions/answers). ing and auto-encoder objectives have been used for pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015). 2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data There has also been work showing effective trans- fer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such as natural language inference (Conneau et al., 2017) and machine translation (McCann et al., 2017). Computer vision research has also demon- strated the importance of transfer learning from large pre-trained models, where an effective recipe is to fine-tune models pre-trained with Ima- geNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014). 3 BERT We introduce BERT and its detailed implementa- tion in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fine-tuning. Dur- ing pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks. For fine- tuning, the BERT model is first initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the param- eters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep- arate fine-tuned models, even though they are ini- tialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section. A distinctive feature of BERT is its unified ar- chitecture across different tasks. There is mini- mal difference between the pre-trained architec- ture and the final downstream architecture. Model Architecture BERT’s model architec- ture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en- coder based on the original implementation de- scribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in the tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use of Transformers has become common and our im- plementation is almost identical to the original, we will omit an exhaustive background descrip- tion of the model architecture and refer readers to Vaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides such as “The Annotated Transformer.”2 In this work, we denote the number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H , and the number of self-attention heads as A.3 We primarily report results on two model sizes: BERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param- eters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M). BERTBASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes. Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans- former uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left.4 1https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor 2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html 3In all cases we set the feed-forward/filter size to be 4H , i.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024. 4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans- Input/Output Representations To make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences (e.g., 〈Question, Answer 〉) in one token sequence. Throughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi- trary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in- put token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin- gle sentence or two sentences packed together. We use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first token of every sequence is always a special clas- sification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the ag- gregate sequence representation for classification tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed- ding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1, we denote input embedding as E, the final hidden vector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH , and the final hidden vector for the ith input token as Ti ∈ RH . For a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings. A visualiza- tion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2. 3.1 Pre-training BERT Unlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al. (2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper- vised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1. Task #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason- able to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-to- right and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately, standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec- tional conditioning would allow each word to in- directly “see itself”, and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context. former is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while the left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer decoder” since it can be used for text generation. In order to train a deep bidirectional representa- tion, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked LM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to- kens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than recon- structing the entire input. Although this allows us to obtain a bidirec- tional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap- pear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do not always replace “masked” words with the ac- tual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then, Ti will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2. Task #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Many important downstream tasks such as Ques- tion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer- ence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela- tionship between two sentences, which is not di- rectly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence rela- tionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen- tence prediction task that can be trivially gener- ated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically, when choosing the sentences A and B for each pre- training example, 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show in Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic- tion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon- strate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6 5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP. 6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation without fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP. [CLS] he likes play ##ing [SEP]my dog is cute [SEP]Input E[CLS] Ehe Elikes Eplay E##ing E[SEP]Emy Edog Eis Ecute E[SEP] Token Embeddings EA EB EB EB EB EBEA EA EA EA EA Segment Embeddings E0 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 Position Embeddings Figure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta- tion embeddings and the position embeddings. The NSP task is closely related to representation- learning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and Logeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior work, only sentence embeddings are transferred to down-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa- rameters to initialize end-task model parameters. Pre-training data The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). For Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti- cal to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to extract long contiguous sequences. 3.2 Fine-tuning BERT Fine-tuning is straightforward since the self- attention mechanism in the Transformer al- lows BERT to model many downstream tasks— whether they involve single text or text pairs—by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs. For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs be- fore applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidi- rectional cross attention between two sentences. For each task, we simply plug in the task- specific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine- tune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in- put, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras- ing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep- resentations are fed into an output layer for token- level tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as en- tailment or sentiment analysis. Compared to pre-training, fine-tuning is rela- tively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa- per can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin- gle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de- scribe the task-specific details in the correspond- ing subsections of Section 4. More details can be found in Appendix A.5. 4 Experiments In this section, we present BERT fine-tuning re- sults on 11 NLP tasks. 4.1 GLUE The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col- lection of diverse natural language understanding tasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are included in Appendix B.1. To fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input sequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs) as described in Section 3, and use the final hid- den vector C ∈ RH corresponding to the first input token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa- tion. The only new parameters introduced during fine-tuning are classification layer weights W ∈ RK×H , whereK is the number of labels. We com- pute a standard classification loss with C and W , i.e., log(softmax(CW T )). 7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in around 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev F1 score of 91.0%. 8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq. https://gluebenchmark.com/faq System MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Average 392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k - Pre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0 BiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0 OpenAI GPT 82.1/81.4 70.3 87.4 91.3 45.4 80.0 82.3 56.0 75.1 BERTBASE 84.6/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6 BERTLARGE 86.7/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1 Table 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard). The number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different than the official GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single- model, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and accuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components. We use a batch size of 32 and fine-tune for 3 epochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate (among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set. Additionally, for BERTLARGE we found that fine- tuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets, so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts, we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per- form different fine-tuning data shuffling and clas- sifier layer initialization.9 Results are presented in Table 1. Both BERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all sys- tems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining 4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im- provement over the prior state of the art. Note that BERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical in terms of model architecture apart from the at- tention masking. For the largest and most widely reported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6% absolute accuracy improvement. On the official GLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score of 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains 72.8 as of the date of writing. We find that BERTLARGE significantly outper- forms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those with very little training data. The effect of model size is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2. 4.2 SQuAD v1.1 The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd- sourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). Given a question and a passage from 9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test labels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server submission for each of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE. 10https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard Wikipedia containing the answer, the task is to predict the answer text span in the passage. As shown in Figure 1, in the question answer- ing task, we represent the input question and pas- sage as a single packed sequence, with the ques- tion using the A embedding and the passage using the B embedding. We only introduce a start vec- tor S ∈ RH and an end vector E ∈ RH during fine-tuning. The probability of word i being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot prod- uct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over all of the words in the paragraph: Pi = e S·Ti∑ j e S·Tj . The analogous formula is used for the end of the answer span. The score of a candidate span from position i to position j is defined as S·Ti + E·Tj , and the maximum scoring span where j ≥ i is used as a prediction. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32. Table 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well as results from top published systems (Seo et al., 2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al., 2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the SQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public system descriptions available,11 and are allowed to use any public data when training their systems. We therefore use modest data augmentation in our system by first fine-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) befor fine-tuning on SQuAD. Our best performing system outperforms the top leaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and +1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single BERT model outperforms the top ensemble sys- tem in terms of F1 score. Without TriviaQA fine- 11QANet is described in Yu et al. (2018), but the system has improved substantially after publication. https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard System Dev Test EM F1 EM F1 Top Leaderboard Systems (Dec 10th, 2018) Human - - 82.3 91.2 #1 Ensemble - nlnet - - 86.0 91.7 #2 Ensemble - QANet - - 84.5 90.5 Published BiDAF+ELMo (Single) - 85.6 - 85.8 R.M.

We use a simple approach to extend the SQuAD v1.1 BERT model for this task. We treat ques- tions that do not have an answer as having an an- swer span with start and end at the [CLS] to- ken. The probability space for the start and end answer span positions is extended to include the position of the [CLS] token. For prediction, we compare the score of the no-answer span: snull = S·C + E·C to the score of the best non-null span 12The TriviaQA data we used consists of paragraphs from TriviaQA-Wiki formed of the first 400 tokens in documents, that contain at least one of the provided possible answers.

We fine-tuned for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 48. The results compared to prior leaderboard en- tries and top published work (Sun et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b) are shown in Table 3, exclud- ing systems that use BERT as one of their com- ponents. We observe a +5.1 F1 improvement over the previous best system. 4.4 SWAG The Situations With Adversarial Generations (SWAG) dataset contains 113k sentence-pair com- pletion examples that evaluate grounded common- sense inference (Zellers et al., 2018). Given a sen- tence, the task is to choose the most plausible con- tinuation among four choices. When fine-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we construct four input sequences, each containing the concatenation of the given sentence (sentence A) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The only task-specific parameters introduced is a vec- tor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep- resentation C denotes a score for each choice which is normalized with a softmax layer. We fine-tune the model for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Re- sults are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGE out- performs the authors’ baseline ESIM+ELMo sys- tem by +27.1% and OpenAI GPT by 8.3%. 5 Ablation Studies In this section, we perform ablation experiments over a number of facets of BERT in order to better understand their relative importance. Additional Dev Set Tasks MNLI-m QNLI MRPC SST-2 SQuAD (Acc) (Acc) (Acc) (Acc) (F1) BERTBASE 84.4 88.4 86.7 92.7 88.5 No NSP 83.9 84.9 86.5 92.6 87.9 LTR & No NSP 82.1 84.3 77.5 92.1 77.8 + BiLSTM 82.1 84.1 75.7 91.6 84.9 Table 5: Ablation over the pre-training tasks using the BERTBASE architecture. “No NSP” is trained without the next sentence prediction task. “LTR & No NSP” is trained as a left-to-right LM without the next sentence prediction, like OpenAI GPT. “+ BiLSTM” adds a ran- domly initialized BiLSTM on top of the “LTR + No NSP” model during fine-tuning. ablation studies can be found in Appendix C. 5.1 Effect of Pre-training Tasks We demonstrate the importance of the deep bidi- rectionality of BERT by evaluating two pre- training objectives using exactly the same pre- training data, fine-tuning scheme, and hyperpa- rameters as BERTBASE: No NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained using the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the “next sentence prediction” (NSP) task. LTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which is trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR) LM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint was also applied at fine-tuning, because removing it introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that degraded downstream performance. Additionally, this model was pre-trained without the NSP task. This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input repre- sentation, and our fine-tuning scheme. We first examine the impact brought by the NSP task. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP hurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by com- paring “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD. For SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions, since the token-level hidden states have no right- side context. In order to make a good faith at- tempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does significantly improve results on SQuAD, but the results are still far worse than those of the pre- trained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks. We recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two mod- els, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer. 5.2 Effect of Model Size In this section, we explore the effect of model size on fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number of BERT models with a differing number of layers, hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training pro- cedure as described previously. Results on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning. We can see that larger models lead to a strict ac- curacy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train- ing examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris- ing that we are able to achieve such significant improvements on top of models which are al- ready quite large relative to the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE contains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con- tains 340M parameters. It has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6. However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convinc- ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been suffi- ciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men- tioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen- sion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improve- ments. Both of these prior works used a feature- based approach — we hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of ran- domly initialized additional parameters, the task- specific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small. 5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT All of the BERT results presented so far have used the fine-tuning approach, where a simple classifi- cation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a down- stream task. However, the feature-based approach, where fixed features are extracted from the pre- trained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Trans- former encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational benefits to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation. In this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data.

We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set. To ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activa- tions from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual em- beddings are used as input to a randomly initial- ized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer. Results are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art meth- ods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden lay- ers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine- tuning and feature-based approaches. 6 Conclusion Recent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architec- tures. Our major contribution is further general- izing these findings to deep bidirectional architec- tures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc- cessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.

Appendix for “BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding” We organize the appendix into three sections: • Additional implementation details for BERT are presented in Appendix A; • Additional details for our experiments are presented in Appendix B; and • Additional ablation studies are presented in Appendix C. We present additional ablation studies for BERT including: – Effect of Number of Training Steps; and – Ablation for Different Masking Proce- dures. A Additional Details for BERT A.1 Illustration of the Pre-training Tasks We provide examples of the pre-training tasks in the following. Masked LM and the Masking Procedure As- suming the unlabeled sentence is my dog is hairy, and during the random masking procedure we chose the 4-th token (which corresponding to hairy), our masking procedure can be further il- lustrated by • 80% of the time: Replace the word with the [MASK] token, e.g., my dog is hairy → my dog is [MASK] • 10% of the time: Replace the word with a random word, e.g., my dog is hairy → my dog is apple • 10% of the time: Keep the word un- changed, e.g., my dog is hairy → my dog is hairy. The purpose of this is to bias the representation towards the actual observed word. The advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been re- placed by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of ev- ery input token. Additionally, because random replacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens (i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm the model’s language understanding capability. In Section C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce- dure. Compared to standard langauge model training, the masked LM only make predictions on 15% of tokens in each batch, which suggests that more pre-training steps may be required for the model BERT (Ours) Trm Trm Trm Trm Trm Trm ... ...

Figure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT uses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to- left LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly conditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fine-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach. to converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that MLM does converge marginally slower than a left- to-right model (which predicts every token), but the empirical improvements of the MLM model far outweigh the increased training cost. Next Sentence Prediction The next sentence prediction task can be illustrated in the following examples. Input = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] he bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP] Label = IsNext Input = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP] Label = NotNext A.2 Pre-training Procedure To generate each training input sequence, we sam- ple two spans of text from the corpus, which we refer to as “sentences” even though they are typ- ically much longer than single sentences (but can be shorter also). The first sentence receives the A embedding and the second receives the B embed- ding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A and 50% of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre- diction” task. They are sampled such that the com- bined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is applied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni- form masking rate of 15%, and no special consid- eration given to partial word pieces. We train with batch size of 256 sequences (256 sequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch) for 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40 epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We use Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear decay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob- ability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti- vation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than the standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The training loss is the sum of the mean masked LM likelihood and the mean next sentence prediction likelihood. Training of BERTBASE was performed on 4 Cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed on 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre- training took 4 days to complete. Longer sequences are disproportionately expen- sive because attention is quadratic to the sequence length. To speed up pretraing in our experiments, we pre-train the model with sequence length of 128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest 10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the positional embeddings. A.3 Fine-tuning Procedure For fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are the same as in pre-training, with the exception of the batch size, learning rate, and number of train- ing epochs. The dropout probability was always kept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values are task-specific, but we found the following range of possible values to work well across all tasks: • Batch size: 16, 32 13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud- TPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global- availability.html • Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5 • Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4 We also observed that large data sets (e.g., 100k+ labeled training examples) were far less sensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data sets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea- sonable to simply run an exhaustive search over the above parameters and choose the model that performs best on the development set. A.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and OpenAI GPT Here we studies the differences in recent popular representation learning models including ELMo, OpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be- tween the model architectures are shown visually in Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec- ture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fine- tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach. The most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor- pus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pre- training tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained: • GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCor- pus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words). • GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and classifier token ([CLS]) which are only in- troduced at fine-tuning time; BERT learns [SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed- dings during pre-training. • GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words. • GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a task-specific fine-tuning learning rate which performs the best on the development set. To isolate the effect of these differences, we per- form ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable. A.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different Tasks The illustration of fine-tuning BERT on different tasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specific models are formed by incorporating BERT with one additional output layer, so a minimal num- ber of parameters need to be learned from scratch. Among the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level tasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In the figure, E represents the input embedding, Ti represents the contextual representation of token i, [CLS] is the special symbol for classification out- put, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate non-consecutive token sequences. B Detailed Experimental Setup B.1 Detailed Descriptions for the GLUE Benchmark Experiments. Our GLUE results in Table1 are obtained from https://gluebenchmark.com/ leaderboard and https://blog. openai.com/language-unsupervised. The GLUE benchmark includes the following datasets, the descriptions of which were originally summarized in Wang et al. (2018a): MNLI Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference is a large-scale, crowdsourced entailment classifi- cation task (Williams et al., 2018). Given a pair of sentences, the goal is to predict whether the sec- ond sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral with respect to the first one. QQP Quora Question Pairs is a binary classifi- cation task where the goal is to determine if two questions asked on Quora are semantically equiv- alent (Chen et al., 2018). QNLI Question Natural Language Inference is a version of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) which has been converted to a binary classification task (Wang et al., 2018a). The positive examples are (ques- tion, sentence) pairs which do contain the correct answer, and the negative examples are (question, sentence) from the same paragraph which do not contain the answer. https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised BERT E[CLS] E1 E[SEP]...

Sentence 2 Figure 4: Illustrations of Fine-tuning BERT on Different Tasks. SST-2 The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a binary single-sentence classification task consist- ing of sentences extracted from movie reviews with human annotations of their sentiment (Socher et al., 2013). CoLA The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability is a binary single-sentence classification task, where the goal is to predict whether an English sentence is linguistically “acceptable” or not (Warstadt et al., 2018). STS-B The Semantic Textual Similarity Bench- mark is a collection of sentence pairs drawn from news headlines and other sources (Cer et al., 2017). They were annotated with a score from 1 to 5 denoting how similar the two sentences are in terms of semantic meaning. MRPC Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus consists of sentence pairs automatically extracted from online news sources, with human annotations for whether the sentences in the pair are semanti- cally equivalent (Dolan and Brockett, 2005). RTE Recognizing Textual Entailment is a bi- nary entailment task similar to MNLI, but with much less training data (Bentivogli et al., 2009).14 WNLI Winograd NLI is a small natural lan- guage inference dataset (Levesque et al., 2011). The GLUE webpage notes that there are issues with the construction of this dataset, 15 and every trained system that’s been submitted to GLUE has performed worse than the 65.1 baseline accuracy of predicting the majority class. We therefore ex- clude this set to be fair to OpenAI GPT. For our GLUE submission, we always predicted the ma- 14Note that we only report single-task fine-tuning results in this paper. A multitask fine-tuning approach could poten- tially push the performance even further. For example, we did observe substantial improvements on RTE from multi- task training with MNLI. 15https://gluebenchmark.com/faq https://gluebenchmark.com/faq jority class. C Additional Ablation Studies C.1 Effect of Number of Training Steps Figure 5 presents MNLI Dev accuracy after fine- tuning from a checkpoint that has been pre-trained for k steps. This allows us to answer the following questions: 1. Question: Does BERT really need such a large amount of pre-training (128,000 words/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve high fine-tuning accuracy? Answer: Yes, BERTBASE achieves almost 1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when trained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps. 2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge slower than LTR pre-training, since only 15% of words are predicted in each batch rather than every word? Answer: The MLM model does converge slightly slower than the LTR model. How- ever, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM model begins to outperform the LTR model almost immediately. C.2 Ablation for Different Masking Procedures In Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model (MLM) objective. The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies. 200 400 600 800 1,000 76 78 80 82 84 Pre-training Steps (Thousands) M N L ID ev A cc ur ac y BERTBASE (Masked LM) BERTBASE (Left-to-Right) Figure 5: Ablation over number of training steps. This shows the MNLI accuracy after fine-tuning, starting from model parameters that have been pre-trained for k steps. The x-axis is the value of k. Note that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap- pears during the fine-tuning stage. We report the Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER, we report both fine-tuning and feature-based ap- proaches, as we expect the mismatch will be am- plified for the feature-based approach as the model will not have the chance to adjust the representa- tions. Masking Rates Dev Set Results MASK SAME RND MNLI NER Fine-tune Fine-tune Feature-based 80% 10% 10% 84.2 95.4 94.9 100% 0% 0% 84.3 94.9 94.0 80% 0% 20% 84.1 95.2 94.6 80% 20% 0% 84.4 95.2 94.7 0% 20% 80% 83.7 94.8 94.6 0% 0% 100% 83.6 94.9 94.6 Table 8: Ablation over different masking strategies. The results are presented in Table 8. In the table, MASK means that we replace the target token with the [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that we keep the target token as is; RND means that we replace the target token with another random token. The numbers in the left part of the table repre- sent the probabilities of the specific strategies used during MLM pre-training (BERT uses 80%, 10%, 10%). The right part of the paper represents the Dev set results. For the feature-based approach, we concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the features, which was shown to be the best approach in Section 5.3. From the table it can be seen that fine-tuning is surprisingly robust to different masking strategies. However, as expected, using only the MASK strat- egy was problematic when applying the feature- based approach to NER. Interestingly, using only the RND strategy performs much worse than our strategy as well. '"

       " 'We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, espe- cially for the fine-tuning approaches.',\n",
       " 'The ma- jor limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi- tectures that can be used during pre-training.',\n",
       " 'For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to- right architecture, where every token can only at- tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).',\n",
